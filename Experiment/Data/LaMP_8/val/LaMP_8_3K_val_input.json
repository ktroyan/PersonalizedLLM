If searching then make sure you find the \u201crestaurant AND BAR\u201d as there is another place now using a shortened name and it comes up first. The real POU is north of road number 6, whereas the clone is on wat bo road. The atmosphere is calming and pleasant, staff unobtrusive, prices are surprisingly low and the food is heavenly. Very very impressed. I live local so I will definitely visit again."

The sounds of birds from nearby trees and surrounding nature makes it such a special atmosphere. The staff was great, super friendly and professional. Like may other Siem Reap establishment, this restaurant is already ahead of the game when it comes to ban the use of plastic straws (lemongrass straws are used instead!). The food was good, not the best I had in town but definitely good for a pleasant dinner in a wonderful environment."

Lovely to talk to the staff too about Covid and their plans for the future. They look after their staff and shows in the quality of service they provide. Some of the best food we ate in Siem Reap"

We had spring rolls which were really fresh and tasty and you could tell they had been made to order. The soup with red nets in it was also really delicious and very different. Not just a gimmick they really add a flavour to the soup. We were on the top level and you feel so far away from the madness of the surrounding town. A real treat for one of our first nights in Cambodia. The staff also got us a tuk tuk to get home as it was pouring with rain when we were ready to leave. Excellent service all round."

They also have a tea room/restaurant down stairs, although you don't get the views. We visited twice in our four days, once for a much needed liquid pitstop and the second time for dinner as the food we saw on our first visit look wonderful. The menu isn't huge but there are plenty of dishes to choose from. They also have a menu of the day priced around 100dhr which is unbelievable value for three courses and tea. a special shout out to our waiter Ismail, who assisted and guided us to our food selections. The food was excellent and extremely tasty."

Bella Cucina is only a small restaurant with the kitchen/pizza oven centre to the room. The menu changes almost daily to some extent, and is not extensive but covers you for choice nicely. Don't load up on bread first (the garlic bread is a pizza size) as the main dishes are plentiful servings. Gnocchi was terrific. Dessert of tiramisu was excellent. The staff member at reception and serving tables was so calm, unflustered and efficient, always with a smile despite the constant queue of people out the door. Would definitely recommend and return."

Straying around the tables you get a visit from here once food is ready. What a funny moment. On our arrival she started her nap at the table next to me. In the moment the starters arrived she immediately woke up and started to \u201echeck\u201c what is going on there. We loved it. Let me get to the starters. The homemade foie gras I choose was delicious but slightly overpriced. 21 Euros for one single slice is too much. Even at Michelin rated restaurants the portion would be better. The main course was great, nothing to complain about. Good usage of spices and herbs, was a nice dish and good eventing. We can recommend this place."

This one was exceptional. Great Praline mousse, nice chocolate sphere, nice crumble combination. It was death of chocolate, a very nice one. So let me begin with the starter. The champignons de bois had an excellent taste, an amazing texture. The salad topping was not mine, but all in a bite very good. The main course was an Argentine Entrecote, cooked to perfection. All these dishes are presented in a good manner at a nice location. The ambiance is great, following the theme of this restaurant. The host and the staff in general: keen, nice, helpful and attentive. Nothing to complain about and to be honest: we ate worse at Michelin Star restaurants. The location of the restaurant cannot be found without TripAdvisor. Hence, no mass tourism and no tourists who want to eat cheap and fast. We had a great evening and an absolutely fantastic dinner. This restaurant needs to be visited for sure!"

All dishes were cooked to perfection and the choice of fresh herbs and spices was excellent. We had lobster for starter to be continued with a great steak in a kind of Bernaise gravy. Was delicious. The hosts are very friendly and even the Maitre appeared at the table to ask for feedback. Well done. I finished that meal with a Cafe Gourmet which was a good choice. The only cons was that inside of restaurants in Morocco it is still allowed to smoke, a pitty especially in restaurants like this where you want to discover all tastes. Finally, we strongly recommend this place for sure and advice you to have a reservation in advance."

My daughter Found her cocktail a little strong so they made her another. Unusual but tasty starters - spinach fritters could have perhaps had slightly less sauce but were delicious. Mains were also good. Extra rice as required and a very good naan bread. Probably not a place to sit and spend a whole evening but for a quick curry and beer it is excellent. Would recommend"

It ain\u2019t cheap, but plenty of Phuket restaurants aren\u2019t these days. It\u2019s a slightly out of the way setting, but that\u2019s ok.

Unfortunately it didn't. 4 slices ( I thought pizzas meant to be huge in the USA) and tasted of nothing.  Very disappointed and would not return."

            "review": "We eat here once or twice a year during our annual stay in Paris and it is one of our favorites. Service this year felt remarkably different. In the past we always received a gluten-free menu for my celiac husband without asking (I specify in my booking that he needs a gluten-free meal). This year we had to ask for it. I ordered a cocktail and my husband an aperitif. Before we even received them, the waiter asked if we wanted to order our meal. I don't think I have ever had that happen in a Michelin-starred restaurant. It felt like dining in a cafe. We said we would prefer to have our drinks and then order. In prior years we always looked forward to the mignardise at the end of the meal. They would always tell my husband which things he could have and fill in with macarons if too many of the usual mignardise had gluten. This time we noticed we were the only table that didn't receive any. We asked the waiter and he said that my husband would not be able to eat them (not true - they included macarons). I asked why did I not get any. He said he assumed that I would not want any if my husband could not have any. That's like saying I would not eat bread at a meal if he couldn't have any. We asked for a manager and he apologized and we got our mignardise. I gave my husband ones that I knew were OK for him and they obviously were since he had no effect from them. The manager gave us his card and assured us that next time he would make sure we were properly taken care of. These are small things, and the cocktail and food and wine were excellent, but we have been here quite a number of times before and the the service was flawless and friendly in the past to the point where a waiter we had on an earlier visit would come over and say hello. Also, it does have a Michelin star and you should not have to worry about anything in such a restaurant. Hopefully this is an isolated incident and does not reflect their normal service."

We had breakfast on Saturday morning -both ordering the English breakfast and then returned again on Sunday morning when I swapped to the English Potato hash. Both mornings we received excellent friendly service from our witnessed but Nora also made a point of coming out of the kitchen and chatting to us and making sure everything was ok. T The food was freshly cooked, plentiful and so tasty with a great menu where anyone can get food to eat -there are Turkish and mediterranean choices, healthy, vegan and vegetarians options. On Saturday one table were requesting changes to their breakfast because they eat only halal meat and on Sunday a Jewish gentleman asked for his breakfast to be cooked in a particular way, nothing was too much trouble. Absolutely no faults to be found. I even used the loo upstairs on Sunday and it was immaculately clean. If we lived nearby it would become a local."

Very high standard overall, and we know our cocktails. Staff friendly and food sounded good, however we were full from lunch so couldn't try any."

We (4) had different Ottoman specials, they were all excellent. I would highly recommend a visit, you will not be disappointed. We had two bottles of red wine from Cappadocia, both were delicious."

All of the staff - Sam, Amp, Will, Puen, Ness and Paul - went out of their way make our experience enjoyable and learn our preferences in terms of level of spiciness. We liked to sit outside with the ocean view so they provided an ice bucket to keep our Singha beers cold. The extensive menu meant we never ate the same main course twice, though we always chose the same shared mixed starters. The Valentine's Day Meal was a particular triumph with an amazing variety of meat, vegetables and seafood, including lobster.  I was also lucky enough to be able to eat here for breakfast on a couple of mornings when they opened up as the hotel was very full. The Chef's Signature Eggs on smashed avocado, tomato salsa and sour dough served to the table with a fresh fruit smoothie and sparkling wine made a heavenly start to the day. I was quite upset when this stopped and I had to return to the busy hotel buffet.  Be sure to make a reservation for dinner as we saw several people turned away as they didn't have space. Thank you Takieng for a five-star dining experience every night of our stay. x"

We love eating out under the stars every night with the sound of the waves crashing on the shore. Service is excellent from start to finish with a shout out to Mama, Fern, Boom, Ammi and all the lovely team who ensured our beer bucket was kept topped up, our favourite table or nearest one was available, and a supply of crispy crackers and dipping sauce started each meal. We enjoyed sampling some of the signature dishes of locally sourced food -Andaman prawns with sea grapes became my favourite starter. Main course portions were very generous. The chef\u2019s willingness to substitute duck for beef in a Mussiman curry and to tone down the heat on some of the spicier dishes was much appreciated. The Valentine\u2019s Meal this year was especially tasty"

The Chicken Caesar is excellent as are the pizzas. My favourite was the Vegetarian and the Napoli which has anchovies.  The Thai people are lovely and the service is excellent. Thank you to our lovely waitresses Poppy and Asia who has looked after us on our dining experiences.  Ooo, by the way if you don\u2019t feel like an alcoholic cocktail, try the Virgin Cocktails. Especially the Pina Colada and the Victorian."

Chad, Fern, Pope and Waan are delightful and always greet you with a smile.  The Spring Rolls and Chicken Satay are my favourite starters and As for mains try the Crusted Parmesan Chicken, delicious! The Duck is also delicious as is the Almaretto Sweet potato ravioli. Can\u2019t go past the Cinnamon Apple Crumble or Sticky Mango Rice, teal favourites.  As there is a huge menu, including Thai Food, you will want to come back again.  Thank you for a great time. See you all again next time."

Also finally the bill was compared to other restaurants in this service and quality level on the lower end. In total we spend for 4 person around 115 $."

Accompanied by seasoned scalloped potatoes the $45 meal deal advertised for 2 has enough meat and potatoes to easily feed 3 people. Based on what other takeaways and restaurants charge in this town this represents a good value. Give it a try you won't be disappointed."

We went for it and didn't regret it. The food was delicious, and the combination of tastes was unbelievable. The wines went perfectly with everything. The staff was very nice, explaining every dish and even the chef came out sometimes to explain the dishes and talk to us. All in all, a lovely experience which we would definitely try again."

Modern decor with lots of natural light.  Had a la carte of veal cheek and lobster to start , extremely tasty and beautifully presented. Not the biggest portions, but they do start you off with amuse buche and some delightful warm bread.  Mains of iberico pork and halibut, which again were delicious and delicately plated but with bold flavours and excellently seasoned.  Cheese trolley followed with a good mix of British and continental. These were very well described and waiters seemed knowledgeable on the flavours and the provenance.  A chocolate delight was then shared to round off an excellent afternoon.  Service was tremendous throughout, attentive but not overbearing with humour and personality.  Look forward to returning. I am sure it will be no time at all before they regain their star."

As soon as we arrived we were greeted with hot cups of tea which we really appreciated on a cold day. And our waitress Sherry kept refilling them. We ordered a dim sum appetizer- watercress & shrimp dumplings, Shanghai lo mein, pork chops with noodles in soup and ice cream for dessert all for around $30. We enjoyed every bite. In looking around everyone seemed to be ordering dim sum plus several other dishes and everything looked delicious! I wish this restaurant was in Phoenix!"

As there were four of us we had quite a bit of the menu - foie gras creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, goats cheese and beetroot, lamb, veal cheek, rabbit, spatzle, pancake with blueberries and sour cream. It was all really lovely as was the bread served with it. It's a bit of a way from the main town but definitely worth the journey."

The food would\u2019ve been better if the server didn\u2019t insist on what we should order and how we should order. Having travelled in many places and eaten at many restaurants, I find it very annoying when server treats American as if we\u2019ve never eaten foreign meals before. How foreign can steak really be!?!? I like the idea of the many different condiments and side items served with the meal on the first visit just to have the different tastes of flavors they offer but I wouldn\u2019t care for it on my next visit. I would come here again but I would insist on ordering what I like rather than what the server insists. I would be more selective on the side items rather than many different items that I don\u2019t care for. For dessert, I ordered a flan which was overwhelming even for 3 people. Flan is already very sweet but they served with large portion of dulce leche."

Riccardo is one of the head chefs who has been in the kitchen for almost 10 years and provides guidance to the fellow workers.  Chad, Fern, Pope and Waan are delightful and always greet you with a smile.  The Spring Rolls and Chicken Satay are my favourite starters and As for mains try the Crusted Parmesan Chicken, delicious! The Duck is also delicious as is the Almaretto Sweet potato ravioli. Can\u2019t go past the Cinnamon Apple Crumble or Sticky Mango Rice, teal favourites.  As there is a huge menu, including Thai Food, you will want to come back again.  Thank you for a great time. See you all again next time."

Thank you to our lovely waitresses Poppy and Asia who has looked after us on our dining experiences.  Ooo, by the way if you don\u2019t feel like an alcoholic cocktail, try the Virgin Cocktails. Especially the Pina Colada and the Victorian."

Although the server told us that the pizza's were \"individual size\" - do not be fooled - these easily feed two. The four of us didn't even finish the two pies. The place does a high volume of deliveries - which leads me to believe they have a very large following of repeat customers.  One negative is that the tables are kind of small."

            "review": "We had lunch at this restaurant on Sunday July 6th.  When we had visited this restaurant, several years back, we were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance and quality of food. So when we arrived in NYC this 4th of July weekend, Utsav was the 1st restaurant that came to mind for Indian food. I made a reservation to make sure we had a place.  We arrived with a lot of anticipation, but were utterly disappointed, by the time we left.  The restaurant started us of on the wrong foot, by stacking up unclean plates. Every plate we picked up (from the stack of plates provided) had food particles stuck to the bottom. Either their dishwasher was spoilt, or whoever was washing the dishes, did a shoddy job. I had to pick through at least 10 plates (supposedly clean) before getting hold of a \u201csomewhat clean plate\u201d.  At the Appetizer counter, there was a man preparing chat. I asked him for a helping, and was told that they will bring it to our table. By the time we left, no one had bothered to get us the chat.  The food quality was well below average, and not commensurate of a restaurant charging over $20/person for the buffet. There were very few items, both for the vegetarian and the non-vegetarian palate. The food tasted like \u201cproduction line\u201d preparation. There were two desert dishes that were clearly below par.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Indian food. Utsav has clearly lost its edge."

The Eggs Benedict is so tasty I couldn\u2019t stop having it, even my wife who usually avoids it couldn\u2019t help herself.

We had really excellent steak here - we both had the bife de chorizo and the meat was among the nicest I have ever had at reasonable prices given the quality. The salad and fries and Malbec were very good too.  I would recommend booking this place and highly recommend the meat. There are plenty of other dishes beyond the steak including other meats and pasta too. It deserves the positive reviews it gets. Service was friendly with some English spoken and it\u2019s a nice traditional style parrilla restaurant.  The locals on either side of us shared steaks rather than take one of their own. The bife de chorizo steaks are big enough for two to share. Apart from cutting the cost down it also leaves room for starters and/or desserts - that\u2019s an option worth considering."

            "review": "The Sohhhak River is actually two restaurants, both of which have the same Khmer menu. The one next door is called the Charnery Tree and only serves the Khmer version. Sokkhak River, however, also has a French Fusion menu as well as tables inside with air conditioning, whereas Chanery Tree only has tables outside. As it wax another hot day in Siem Reap I opted to eat insid.  The French menu is really a Western menu offering mostly steaks, seafood and pasta main dishes for around $20-25. The Khmer menu is about half that price and looked much more interesting offering local classics like Amok, Lok Lak as well as the temptingly exotic Grilled Stuffed Frog, but as I was feeling less adventurous I opted for the Tonle Sap Steamed Fish ($11.50); Bar fish fillet with garlic, shallot, basil, spring onion, cashew and lime dressing. To drink with lunch I ordered a glass of the Obikwa Chardonnay from South Africa. Like all the red and white wines by the glass this cost $5.80.  The Chardy was nice - quite a lot of body with pear flavours. An easy drinking cheap and cheerful! The Sokkhak is very comfortable and stylish. There are two red and black display cases filled with small potted tropical plants, statues and other knick knacks that subtly divide the space in two, black tiled floors, contemporary local art on the walls, and dark wood sideboards where the settings are kept. I had a table near one of the windows that looked out onto a narrow breezeway filled with ferns that separated the restaurant from its sister property next door.  My main was delivered quickly and was very good. The fish was tasty and soft, and the sauce tart and flavoursome but not so much as to over power the main ingredient. The cashews added a nice crunch to an otherwise soft-mouthed dish. I think I did a good job matching the wine too as this complemented the dish very well.  I'd had the tasting menu at another high end restart just next door called Malis a couple of nights before which I really liked, but a couple of locals said this place was better. Personally I liked them both, but it's hard to compare the diverse tastes and experience of a degustation against a single dish. However based on the one I tried here today I'd have to call it a tie. I'd really like Chanery Tree/Sokkhak to introduce a tasting plate to their menu as there were a lot of things they do that I'd really like to try - starting, of course, with the stuffed frog"

Whilst at the resort we made a number of visits to the Sala Sawasdee bar. It\u2019s a great place to relax and have a drink, regardless if you\u2019re a hotel guest or visiting from the outside.  Something that really makes the place special is the staff and the stand out for my family was Mai Butsaba. It has been over a year since our last visit and Mai instantly recognised my family and particularly my daughters. She went out of her way to make us feel welcome on every visit. Thank you Mai.  It\u2019s a great spot to sit and have a cocktail on the evening when the fire show is on, just get there early to make sure you get a water side day bed.  Thanks Sala Sawasdee team and especially Mai, we have a wonderful visit and look forward to seeing you all again soon."

            "review": "We had the best meal (gluten-free as well) in Siem Reap at Haven! The food was absolutely superb and the concept--training the locals to help themselves--is brilliant. The service was perfect and the food, oh my stars, the food! Magnificent!  If you're wondering where to dine while in Siem Reap, look no further and secure your reservation as soon as possible. We were so fortunate to have secured a table. Seriously, we speak so highly of this restaurant, even compared to the Embassy.  We had the fresh spring rolls and the pomelo salad, the outstanding beef loc lac, fish soup, and chicken Khmer curry. We had three traditional Cambodian desserts. The loc lac was amazing! Amazing! The Khmer curry was the absolute best of all the places we dined at in Siem Reap. Honestly and truthfully, so amazing. As a matter of fact, while we were fine dining at the Embassy, we were contemplating heading over to Haven after to scoop up a heartier meal. The desserts were delicious and like written online, were not sweet, swimming in coconut milk, and served hot. Everything was a winner and the chef was able to make the fried calamari gluten-free as well.  Danke Schoen for the best meal. So looking forward to dining at Haven on our next visit.  Notes: al fresco dining and not a mosquito in sight.  $65 USD"

Very tasty though. The juices were the most enjoyable part of the dining experience, oh, and the gluten-free coconut ice cream.  Overall, decent. Really bummed to have not had the outstanding experience that others had. Maybe we were just too early and the kitchen wasn't prepared. Bummer."

To top it up, we had mutka kulfi and rasmalai of the highest quality. This place is not massive; but ambiance was great with friendly staff and excellent service. There are some parking spaces right outside on the street. This place is a must visit for lovers of Awadhi, Hyderabadi cuisine. Bon appetit!!!"

We started the evening with their Brie Melters, which are pieces of Brie cheese deep-fried in a homemade batter. We paired the appetizer with a glass of Prosecco, currently on promotion.  Following this, we ordered the Lamb Stew and the Spaghetti Deluxe, in a rich red wine sauce. Sensational!  All-in-all, the quality of the ingredients, combined with the skilled knowledge of the kitchen brigade and the professionalism of the staff made this evening way more special than it should have been.  Highly recommended if you are in Kathu, or in Phuket Town."

As others have mentioned this is a fixed menu only type of restaurants so you need to be flexible but what came out of the kitchen on the night we were there did not disappoint one bit. What was interesting is that unlike many of the other restaurants we went to during our trip to France, Aspic offered a wine pairing with the meal which was quite nice and added an extra layer to the experience.  Service was overall good but you need to go into this with the right expectation that this is a lean operation. As far as I could tell there was the chef in the kitchen and one waitress for about 12 tables. It didn't feel slow or anything but it wasn't \"high touch\" either.  Overall we were pleasantly surprised with the experience. When the check came in, we were even more surprised at how affordable this experience was. Given the quality and creativity, I don't think it's going to stay this way for long so you better go and enjoy it!"

We opted for the signature tasting with premium wines and we were not disappointed! Each course was flavorful with premium ingredient and original presentation. Service was friendly, attentive and efficient. The wine pairing although expensive really helped bring an additional dimension to the food with the sommelier walking us through each pairing in details.  Overall we had a wonderful night at Jungsik and even though it's not as well known as some of the other high-end restaurants in New York, we highly recommend you give it a shot!"

Take the meal as the chef intends the experience to be and make sure to absolutely add the wine pairings. The flavors of the perfectly chosen wines are essential to the full experience and appreciation of the complex flavors. We have had meals of this type several times but this was definitely one of the best. The intricacy of the preparation to pair multiple different types of ingredients (sometimes ones you would not think would go together) to get a specific flavor or texture is truly amazing. I can\u2019t really cook much of anything so this of course is even more special for me \u2013 as I LOVE to eat great food. Only 20 seats in this compact and quaint place so make sure you book well in advance if you want this experience. The staff was wonderful and the evening was perfect \u2013 especially since it was our 25th anniversary."

The selection of wines is outstanding and the bespoke meals are great combination of the best ingredients and artistic skills of the chef. The cocktails and whisky to finish the evening just added to the festivities."

On the day of our booking the restaurant called to confirm the booking and amount of guests, this was fine. My partner called back to confirm we still needed seating fot 35 this is when the restaurant surprised us by stating we would have to buy 7 family platters, this surprised us. Their response was they were very busy and this is indeed the time to make money. This is appalled us how can someone do this 2 hours before our booking. The restaurant were unhelpful and customer service was not top of their priority it was money for so called 20 kitchen staff and the time of the year and being busy. So if they were not busy they would have happily honoured our reservation without an issue.  Thank you for spoiling my 6 year olds birthday and causing us a headache on New Years Eve in finding another venue.  I would not be coming back to this restaurant nor will my family members who have been going here for many years.  I would not recommend this restaurant for their customer service, if you want a spoilt event then this is the place for you."

You come across the front door, which looks like an abandoned storefront, ring the doorbell, then enter into the most intimate, romantic, charming place ever. You are blown away from the very first course. A truly artistic vision. And DELICIOUS! Each course is amazingly paired with wine. We ate and drank for 3.5 hours (a record for me!) but did not leave drunk or stuffed. Full and giddy would be a more accurate description. I truly hope you have a chance to visit this wonderful secret. And the price is surprisingly affordable (in American terms - we paid just over $100 per person)."

The slow cooked meat melted in your mouth and the potatoes were delicious. Maybe a little more potato is warranted for four people. We thought that, last time we were in Queenstown a few years ago. We did order a salad to go with it and although tasty, was nothing like the salad in the photos online. We would use this venue again. Not a large menu, but a tasty one."

I tried a chicken & beef taco. We\u2019ve traveled to Mexico but these taco\u2019s were even better. The place was packed but it was a very well run, clean fast food establishment that provided great service. All employees were extremely patient and polite while they answered my daughters questions about the food. My family and I were very impressed. If you\u2019re in the area, Los Tacos is worth a visit. You will not be disappointed. Thank you Los Tacos for a lunch I won\u2019t ever forget! If I ever get back to NYC, I will definitely return."

At fisrt, the place sends a message of being vibrant and cosy, with musiciens playing soft jazz and blues. As our experience started, service was precise and extremely attentive; the waiter was caring without excess but in a very simple and polite manner. Nothing different to expect from a restaurant one could say, however, experiences in NYC have not always showed the same. The quality of our dinner has been outstanding: we shared a starter - a crab cake- was extremely fresh and generous. The entree - a porterhouse for two- was perfectly served, at the right temperature, which is not easy when requesting beef to be bleu! Throughout our dinner, the presence and the eye of the owner - Mr Bruno Selimaj - never stopped being there, himself taking personal care of all guests well-being.  This is our seventh trip to NYC, without having being able to travel here in the past two years because of COVID, but Club A is an address we will keep in our minds for our next visit: a restaurant you must experience!"

The Sauvignon Blanc was excellent. I\u2019d take off half a star for the temperature of the food (not quite hot enough for me) but overall a wonderful dinner and would eat there again.

Very plesant and professional staff, moderate prices. Worth to visit while in Paris, dinner time reservation is a must."

Sea scalop dish come on time from the kitchen but served bit late, hence temperature was not good, it would be much better that it was served on time. Knife for meat dish was with wooden handle which is against HACCP standard. One of the service personnel had scent of cigarettes on his fingers (must say this was noticed when bill was presented, not during food service) All the rest was very good and food was really tasty. Reception was very professional, very good and clean rest room facility. Price wise this was on high end side. Still, I recommend this place."

When you find the restaurant you do have to walk up a few flights of stairs so in my opinion you would need to be physically fit.  The choice of food is good giving you options and also the opportunity to have meat or vegetarian bowls.  The atmosphere was good giving you a relaxed feel and also gentle music was playing in the background.  The price was reasonable aswell and we would recommend"

            "review": "We ate here our last night on a recommendation from our hotel. If we had found it sooner we would have eaten here more often. Dinner for 3 was about $200 for 2 mains, three appetizers, 6 drinks, one dessert. Rodrigo did a marvelous job waiting on us. We will be back if we are ever here again. In warm weather there is outside dining in the shadow of the Charles Bridge. Here are the items we really liked: scallops, celery cream soup, goat cheese salad, filet schnitzel (sounds odd but great) and cream puff. Full bar with all the usual mixed drinks. Very pleasant setting with just enough ambient noise to allow a normal conversation. Reservation needed if you want a preferential seating location."

The concept is that you can chose from a choice of fish and meats, chose your style and combine the two. The tasting platter is put together by the chef. We especially liked the Tuna Ni\u00e7oise, a mix we otherwise wouldn't have tried! Definitely recommend that, the Italian veal (like a carpaccio) and the beef house-style. The Pok\u00e9 Salmon was also good, but obviously similar to a normal salmon pok\u00e9.  The portions of the tasting platter are rather small and we felt like some could've used a bit more spices or salt as they were quite bland. The dessert on the other hand was amazing! We had the speculoos Tiramisu and I would go back just for that dessert! Absolutely great.  Service was quick and attentive although our server seemed to be new. The owner (I assume) was great though.  There's a bus stop right in front of the restaurant."

I had a spinach based curry which was spicier than expecting and didn't have a lot of chicken in it, my colleague had a tikka masala which he found lacking in flavour.  Rice was ok....had peas in it which was odd (for an indian) but then we've experienced peas on pizza this week so not all that weird.  The poppadoms we had for starters were strange, cone shaped and quite small but they were fairly priced so not a problem, not enough indian dips with them though.  Usual selection of drinks, no problems there and the peshwari naan was very good.  Some people came in with a very large dog, don't really like dogs in restaurants but it was fairly well behaved so not a major issue."

            "review": "We came here for dinner on the night we landed in Paris. Our flight was supposed to arrive at 8:20pm, and their last order was at 10:15pm (be aware that even though they offer 10:30pm reservations on La Fourchette, they don't actually do that), so I initially canceled because I was worried we'd miss the reservation. They were exceedingly nice and understanding during the email exchange, and so when we arrived on time and realized we could still make it, we had our hotel call them, and they were able to accommodate us.  Particularly for a late night dinner, the meal was better than I could have expected. The servers were kind and didn't rush us at all even though we ordered the chef's menu. Particularly memorable was the artichoke soup which was divine, the best I'd ever had with bits of artichoke mixed in with the velvety smooth soup. My husband, who is usually a non-meat eater, said the lamb was one of the best he had tasted. If you come here, you must have the bread, even if you are trying to cut down on carbs. It's absolutely delicious. On this night, we had something that looked like parker rolls, but actually tasted like a nice focaccia, and a perfectly baked sourdough slice.  If you are a dessert lover like me, you will love the long list of some of the most scrumptious choices I've seen at a restaurant in a long time. The menu came with a caramel mille-feuille, which I enjoyed, but I also saw tantalizing plates of souffl\u00e9s, berry tarts etc etc making its way toward other tables. I would love to come and just eat all of their desserts.  The restaurant was located inside the Bristol hotel, which is a former palace. The warm and unpretentious service combined with the amazing food even made me curious about staying here next time.  Pricewise, this is a one Michelin restaurant, so it's in the typical range of similarly rated establishments. Frankly, however, this was a better meal than two-Michelin places we've been to on out previous trip two months ago, so from that perspective we considered it to be, maybe not a bargain, but completely worth it."

The potatoes where a luxury not needed, the complimentary cranberry walnut bread was more than enough. Friendly, helpful owner and staff, very good English spoken. Worth the detour!"

Christa is where we spent our last night when our holiday came to an abrupt end, we enjoyed a B52 shooter and a couple of cocktails all was delicious, staff lovely and high hygiene standards."

Entrees of Carciofini ripieni and Caprese followed by Paccher al ragu and Vitello al Marsala. Just one dessert a lovely Panna Cotta. All washed down with two glasses of Pinot Grigio, San Pellegrino and one Cappuccino and a Limoncello. Total with tip an expensive $200 - but worth every cent! Just missed out on excellent because we did feel a bit rushed as they obviously like to turn tables quickly at the weekend."

We ordered two different chicken dishes, while we waited were served a plethora complimentary items, all very tasty and almost worth visiting for alone. Also the service was very good (something quiet uncommon in Argentina). We were a little put off by the paper table cloth and ikea style glasses, I think at this price they can do better.  Still we were really happy until the mains arrived, these we exceptionally dry, fatty and tasteless. If I had cooked that at home I would be apologising to my family. One dish was virtually inedible because it had been crisped so much on the outside and the inside was tasteless. Very disappointing."

Also one of the few places in Paris we've found that actually offers a decent choice of premium gins, while in Belgium even the most modest 'brasserie' has a couple of gins to choose from. The maitre does an excellent job and the paired wines were excellent. We paid \u20ac100 each for a gin and tonic, the menu with paired wines and a cognac. That is great value for food this good."

The food was of a very good standard, well cooked and presented very professionally. The wine menu was also well selected and varied. The thing that let this venue down was the poor level of service generally. The lady serving us was appeared confused, did not know what was on the menu (the menu id not particularly lengthy) and paid poor attention to us even though it was fairly empty. Instead both her and her colleague focused on two gentlemen who we assumed were regularly from their conversations. We also waited a very long time after having our plates cleared away before being offered desert. For such a venue and with prices set as they are I would have expected better having dined at a large number of other places in Prague of the same level. My wife and I do not plan on coming back again."

They should put a sign on the door saying full as the staff had to constantly turn away people.  Quite a few small plates to choose from with an ample list of wines to pair with them.  We had the garlic shrimp, Italian meatballs, salmon in crispy Philo and the potatoes with bacon and cheese. Good flavors, but shrimp and salmon were way over cooked, shrimp could have been a frozen product.  The place feels like a small gathering of friends for wine and appetizers so it's a great concept and the personal service is very good, but our food experience led us to feel that it is possibly overrated."

We started with the bruschetta, great focaccia and garlic flavor...then had the carbonara and the spaghetti with frutta di mare. Both were served steaming hot and were flavorful. The crispy guanciale lent a nice smoky element to the carbonara. The frutta di mare was good too but the shrimp were very small and probably were a frozen component.  Finished with a pistachio semifreddo, which was very good!  The service by Marcela was excellen  The total, including 2 bottles of water, 3 glasses of wine, a cappuccino and a 15% tip, came to 2600 Ckn or about US$110.00, a bit on the expensive side, but very good."

Then had the glazed perch and the chicken tikki masala...presented very well and great flavors as well. The perch flaked perfectly, accompanied by grilled cauliflower and a leek slaw. Delicious! My wife's chicken was tender and nicely spiced, served with lentils and basmati rice.  Finished with a portion of warm apple strudel ice cream.  Had a nice ros\u00e9 and made for a perfect dinner! Not cheap at 3500 CzK but we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner."

            "review": "The food was phenomenal, and the service was excellent. Some of the descriptions of the food, spices, and inspirations for the dishes were a little unfamiliar coming from a Korean influence, but the food definitely gives a sense of place. Each dish was flawless, although the Mackerel dish was a little too fishy for our taste. (Our mistake for never having had Mackerel before.) The Octopus was delicious; tender and perfect. The Bossam (pork belly rice) was beautifully porky without being greasy. The Sea Bream was delicate and flavorful. I would recommend the Galbi (pork ribs), but you can also have them on W 32nd probably just as good but not on such a pretty plate. The desserts were works of art that were as tasty as they were beautiful. The Jang Dok were little kimchi pots made of ganache which was a nice way for the chef to tell his story. Likewise for the Harubang, by far the prettiest plate. I wish there was a little bit more light so we could have enjoyed the beauty of these plates. Wine list is excellent. The service was spot-on and polished, although a little reserved. We were able to warm up our servers a little by asking some questions and they showed some personality."

It's not always easy to get seated as a group of 16 but Bill's is two floors with plenty of space and they seated us right away in the middle of lunch rush. By the time we left it was close to full so glad we showed up when we did. Most of us went the burger route. I had the chili which is thick and served with tortilla chips for dipping. Everyone enjoyed their meal, the prices were reasonable, and the service was friendly and made sure drinks stayed full."

All served food looked fresh and well presented, western restaurant look and perhaps taste as well. However, i can't fault it :) Prices are very cheap as in comparison same dishes that don't taste as nice cost double around Pub Street-city centre (5 min walk). So it is certainly a good value and portions' size are good. Staff are very attentive, humble and happy :) This place is full of europeans and western people. Perhaps lacking a little of atmosphere/traditional music/cambodian decor. Nevertheless, 5 stars from me :)"

Fine appetisers, and a six-course menu that offered great tastes and used high-quality products. Cheese options are limited but quality is great. Deserts were fine. In terms of price, the six-course menu is very reasonable. The wine list is large but rather expensive....A perfect meal with one suggestion: please change this horrible music!"

We had the tasting menu and matching wine flight over the course of about 4 hours.  A series of lovely \u201csnacks\u201d to get started and then into the actual menu. There wasn\u2019t a bum note here, everything was superb but special mention goes to the scallop and smoked eel which was exceptional.  The wine flight was as good as I\u2019ve had anywhere, great pairing and a lot of interesting choices of slightly less mainstream varieties and locations.  Service throughout was very good.  We will definitely return in the future."

Here at Caf\u00e9 Nora (formerly Caf\u00e9 Thyme), there are nine fry-ups to choose from, ranging from \u00a36.95 to \u00a37.95, all cooked to order and served with tea or freshly ground coffee and toast or bread. The English Breakfast of two eggs, two rashers of bacon, sausage, hash browns, baked beans, mushroom, black pudding and grilled tomatoes is a firm favourite. There\u2019s also a Mediterranean Set Breakfast and Vegan Brunch with vegan sausage and avocado. For the more adventurous, there is Eggs Benedict, omelettes, pastas, salads, pancakes, burgers, panini, jacket potatoes, sandwiches and filled baguettes. Something for everyone. Situated in East London\u2019s popular Petticoat Lane Market, on Wentworth Street and near the corner of Middlesex Street, the caf\u00e9 is run by Turkish chef Ebru Puleri and her female Turkish friends. It\u2019s a friendly, warm place, with comfortable seating, and popular with local workers, neighbours, market traders, students and visitors to London. It is walking distance from Aldgate East Tube and Liverpool Street Station. Open daily from early morning to 3pm."

I had the apothecary , vodka and gin based with fresh geranium leaf, excellent. Mum had their equivalent of a pina colada. I don\u2019t normally like whisky cocktails but my husbands \u2018 marrakech market\u2019 was fabulous. We had sharing plates, all really tasty, of mini burgers, steak with chimchurri, fried octopus. Fantastic designed place too as a speakeasy and wonderful welcome and looked after. So refreshing, It\u2019s these sorts of places that will draw us back to marrakech"

            "review": "In Paris, the competition in the fine dining category is fierce.  It\u2019s as if every night is a playoff game and everyone is gunning for the title. Here, a Michelin Star might actually be worth more than in other cities. And if you\u2019re lucky enough to be on vacation, with back-to-back dinners at this level, you would imagine that someone has to lose. It was with this pressure we dined at Pur, having just experienced newly starred Saturne the night before.  Would there be space for its unique take on starred excellence?  Pur is a classic fine dining experience. This is not a let down. Imagine the finest ingredients in unique combinations. Now imagine them served at a level that take six dishes and create wonderful arc.  While identifying individual dishes is useless as Chef Aie Okabayashi is sure to adjust the menu based on what\u2019s seasonal, the one prevailing taste we encountered was \u201csmoke\u201d. Similar to the essence of barbecue, there were hits of smoke and wood in unexpected delicate places like fish. Yes there was a duck course that was one of the best\u2026the skin by alone could have been a delicacy.  Lest we forget, two of the six courses were desserts, with a palate cleanser that could be a dish in itself. Actually, the that cleaner tart \u201csouffl\u00e9\u201d was probably our favorite, and the pastry chef, who busily prepped dishes all night next to our chef\u2019s table, humbly admitted it was his as well.  We opted not to commit to the wine pairings, but the Sancerre and Margeux by the glass were excellent. If you prefer cocktails, their take on the Moscow Mule is worth the price. And don\u2019t be intimidated by the six-courses. It\u2019s the right size and takes about three hours, so it was well-paced.  Finally, the service was superb. It doesn\u2019t hurt that we were seated at the chef\u2019s table with a window into the kitchen where Chef was making sure no detail was overlooked. And yes she made one trainee remake a simple amuse-bouche simply because he failed to sprinkle the dust in the right direction. And an anniversary cake for a couple celebrating theirs was reset because it sat a few minutes too long.  Situated in the sexy Park Hyatt Vendome, this is far more than a \u201chotel\u201d restaurant. It\u2019s epic\u2026they brought their A-game on an average Tuesday evening. But hey, this is Paris, and the next Michelin wannabe is right around the corner!  The good news is that Pur has the goods, elegance and fine creations, to keep that star shining."

We also ordered papas frittes, which looked delicious but we were so pleased they didn't come. The wine list was great and we enjoyed a nice bottle of Malbec. After our meal we were so full so no dessert. La Cabrera Norte was one of our favorite restaurants in BA. Definitely check it out."

We then saw all the food coming out and it looked beautiful. After a while, we decided some nachos. The previous night we visited a Mexican and had nachos and the ones at \u2018The Street\u2019 were much better. The nachos were that could we decided to stay even longer and order a burger each. We ordered the burger with the 4 different types of cheese and the chicken in cornflakes. Both were delicious and they were huge! We both agreed they are the best burgers we\u2019ve had in a while and we would 100% recommend."

We didn't reserve and were really lucky we came early (around 7pm) to get a table. Many people came in after us and were turned down. Do make a booking. It's cosy inside, the service was fantastic, both manager and waiters were checking from time to time if everything was ok. Actually everything was more than ok - so delicious! Try their pastilla - thinnest filo pastry almond and chicken pie - it's so good. I've had the Gazelles tagine sweet/salty, loved and ate everything. Reasonable priced - our bill for 2 people based on main course, 2 mint teas and 1 starter shared came to 230 Dirhams that is equivalent to \u00a318. Like most other restaurants in town, unless it's a hotel, they don't serve alcohol. It's not far from Jamal el-Fna so when you've had enough of wandering about, it's a great place o recharge the batteries."

We were quite surprised that after such a long time the restaurant was still making memories for locals and tourists alike.  This is not a restaurant that you decide to drop in on at the last minute. It's often booked out well in advance and sports around 7 or so tables for a very intimate dining experience with friends or loved ones. In fact, we booked over a month in advance to make sure they could seat our party of 5.  Plan to take your time and this is one location that it pays to trust the kitchen, as they have a fantastic degustation menu, featuring ingredients from the South Island of New Zealand. Matching New Zealand wines are also on offer and in my opinion you're missing a fabulous experience if you choose to \u00e0 la carte.  We started the evening with cocktails followed by a dish titled \"Amuse\" - described as a daily creation or local delicacy. On this day, we were served a starter of Cervena Venison. It came cooked perfectly with 3 beautiful contrasting sauces.  The next dish was a choice from the Southern Ocean or Marlborough region, scallops or wild boar respectively. I chose the boar - Mille Peuille of apple, parsnip remoulade with a well matched Amisfield Pinot Gris from Central Otago.  The next course hailed from the West Coast or Bannockburn - Conit of baby abalone, or Seared Loin of hare and braised leg. The hare was served with confit kumura (New Zealand native sweet potato), sour cherries, kawakawa jus and a Surveyor Thompson Pinot Noir from Central Otago.  A nice little citrus sorbet followed as a palate cleanser.  The Main course was either a Centrol Otago Alpine Merino lamb backstrap and braised neck, or Nelson sourced seared pink snapper. The Merino Lamb was spectacular, served with baby vegetables, pea sponge, thyme jus and a Church Road Reserve Merlot/Cabernet blend from the Hawkes Bay.  Dessert was a classic New Zealand kiwi fruit pavola with local fruit and mascarpone with a Brancott Letter Series Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough.  Lastly, we were treated to a local cheese selection with figs, nuts and a Cloudy Bay Late Harvest Riesling from Marlborough once again.  The wait staff were fantastic. Every course was described in detail and the quality of service was second to none.  Treat yourself to an experience and make sure The Bunker is on your list when you next visit Queenstown.  Highly Recommended."

            "review": "Checked out some review on Tripadvisor before heading out for some evening drinks and food. We decided to have a stroll around some of Lisbons many bars and eateries and graze on some of the fantastic food. ( well that was the plan ) We both liked the look of Grau Douro from the reviews and found the establishment very easily in Rua Dunques de Braganca. On arrival the small (but cosy) place was very busy and having no booking we were offered a seat at the bar.This offer was accepted and the owner came straight over with the drinks menu , we are not knowledgeable about Portuguese wine so asked for some guidance. He asked what we liked and suggested a couple of wines ( neither were expensive) and promptly poured a taste of each, followed by a full measure. We quaffed the lovely wine ordered some more and asked for the food menu. The owner who was clearly in control of the whole show was exhilarating to watch , moving from table to table , laughing and joking with the customers and even playing the accordion from time to time a delight to observe. The food arrived Covert ( bread with oil ) the Prawns in garlic sauce and a portion of Bacalhau a bras (codfish , slices of potato and egg cooked in the oven) both dishes were absolutely delicious. Unfortunately by siting at the bar the Toucinho do Ceo do Avo ( Grandpa`s Heavenly Tart ) was positioned on the bar top just in front of us , so a portion along with a very nice glass of port had to be consumed to finish the night. Everything about the place is fantastic, the food is amazing , the staff are friendly and great , the atmosphere is homely , all in all a great find , needless to say we only managed the one bar that night best laid plans and all that. Grau Douro thankyou for a Fantastic Evening. We will be back."

Firstly, there was only two or maybe three options for vegetarians and the food that was served was extremely bland. There was no spice, no sauce, no flavour on any of the food that was served. Despite being a vegetarian I was served a dish that had prawn in and was told that it was vegetarian. I was extremely dissatisfied with the food and it was a rip off considering I was still hungry and actually ate again at home. The staff and chef however were extremely hospital and helpful, I could not fault the service but I would not go back for the food. If you are vegetarian, do not waste your time going here, I will not be going back."

It was also clear conveniently located to our hotel. The ambiance inside is very charming. The menu is fairly extensive, Lucky our very efficient server was a huge help in deciphering some of the lesser known items. We started with shrimp and a fried spinach appetizers, both were fantastic. For entrees, we sampled a nice cross section of dishes, including shrimp, vegetarian, chicken and lamb. The highlight entree was the \u201cK\u201d special platter with a mixed grill of lamb and chicken cooked in different styles. Several flavors of naan bread rounded out our entrees. Lucky took great care of us throughout the meal and we thought the prices here were reasonable."

So friendly caring, always with a smile and greeted us by name every day. The service has been 5 star. I warmly recommend staying at Theanna villas and enjoying this restaurant every day The highlight has been the floating breakfast this morning in our villa pool. Wow . This is a must when visiting Theanna Villas in Canguu. Thank you beautiful Putri."

Reservation is recommendable because the place was packed. Very nice ambiance inside, great decor all around. We sat near the small bar at a small table. The table appeared to be really small, only just big enough to place our complete meal on. Indian food comes in many bowls and platters, so... About the food: wow. Just wow. So delicious! We eat Indian regularly, but this is #1 so far! We loved it!! We choose not spicy. Started with vegetable samosa and fried shrimps. Already very delicious. Then came the Dal Makhani: Black lentils cooked overnight in the Tandoor finished with tomato sauce & cream. A prawn curry; Tiger prawns in rich sauce with cashews and coconut and the Kashmiri Pulao: Rice mixed with sliced fruits and nuts flavored with aromatic cashmere herbs and cream. I had the pineapple raita and a cheese naan with it. Too much but O man. To die for. So good. So good. So, when in Prague avoid the busy squares and find K the two brothers in old town. Very very recommendable!! Great staff, very attentive, very nice guys! Must eat here when in Prague."

We love eating out under the stars every night with the sound of the waves crashing on the shore. Service is excellent from start to finish with a shout out to Mama, Fern, Boom, Ammi and all the lovely team who ensured our beer bucket was kept topped up, our favourite table or nearest one was available, and a supply of crispy crackers and dipping sauce started each meal. We enjoyed sampling some of the signature dishes of locally sourced food -Andaman prawns with sea grapes became my favourite starter. Main course portions were very generous. The chef\u2019s willingness to substitute duck for beef in a Mussiman curry and to tone down the heat on some of the spicier dishes was much appreciated. The Valentine\u2019s Meal this year was especially tasty"

All of the staff - Sam, Amp, Will, Puen, Ness and Paul - went out of their way make our experience enjoyable and learn our preferences in terms of level of spiciness. We liked to sit outside with the ocean view so they provided an ice bucket to keep our Singha beers cold. The extensive menu meant we never ate the same main course twice, though we always chose the same shared mixed starters. The Valentine's Day Meal was a particular triumph with an amazing variety of meat, vegetables and seafood, including lobster.  I was also lucky enough to be able to eat here for breakfast on a couple of mornings when they opened up as the hotel was very full. The Chef's Signature Eggs on smashed avocado, tomato salsa and sour dough served to the table with a fresh fruit smoothie and sparkling wine made a heavenly start to the day. I was quite upset when this stopped and I had to return to the busy hotel buffet.  Be sure to make a reservation for dinner as we saw several people turned away as they didn't have space. Thank you Takieng for a five-star dining experience every night of our stay. x"

Ordered bubble n squeak which was delicious but one poached egg was rock hard and one was soft. Asked a waitress for pepper but it never came. The food was delicious despite the above. The restaurant has a bizarre wait in Q to order which makes the entry very congested.  Had an almond latte which are hard to find in NZ and it was spot in.  Overall very good just missed on a couple of small things."

We had the 3 course set menu which was great value. Bill was around $100 with tip for 3 courses and drinks.  Curry I very flavourful but not very hot, starters and appetisers were very nice. A traditional Indian ice cream for desert which was a bit strange at first but very nice. Would recommend for a nice Curry in NY, good central location as well, near Rockefeller Center."

Friendly young staff, simple menu of local and Thai dishes. We had satay and spring rolls, as everyone said how good they were! Followed by chicken in ginger and a Khmer red curry. All dishes were tasty, but the rice stood out! Not just plain steamed white rice but brown, it made a lovely change. The prices were slightly higher than other places but the ethos is good. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s better than the rest as all the food and restaurants we have been to offer great value and similar food. But a nice change"

It is probably a little more expensive than some others - but not by a great degree and the setting, atmosphere, service, and food meant we didn't mind."

The view from the restaurant was great. Good before the sunset so that you can enjoy both the sunset and the night view.  Alfresco dining is recommended because you will have the unblocked view to the sea and the pool. But get ready your insect repellent and embrace the heat because the fans weren't helping much.  We ordered a set menu for 2 pax. Was decent but nothing exceptional. The pace of serving was a little too lengthy, we actually got bored waiting for food after a while. We got seated by 6 pm and we left the restaurant at 8.30 pm.  Would I recommend this to anyone? If you are staying at the resort, why not because you don't have much choices there.  If you are making a trip here from elsewhere, I don't think you miss much."

The event runs three times a week in a space that is typically reserved for a wine club. Although our group had about 20 people in it, it served to be a very intimate experience. The night began with a toast and traditional appetizers while mingling with other guests and staff. We continued by a nice presentation of the food and an introduction to the evening by the staff. Next, we sat down for a wonderful dinner - each part of which was superb. My boyfriend's favorite part of the evening was being able to head outside on the balcony with Luis, who showed him grilling techniques and talked about his experience with gastronomy. The food, wine, and company were all wonderful, and we loved being able to meet people during such an enjoyable experience - we have even kept in contact with a few! The staff was absolutely fantastic. Luis was happy to share his knowledge, Pierre was knowledgable and very interesting to talk with, and the rest of the staff was superb as well. A definite highlight of our trip!"

It was my daughter's 21st birthday celebrations, and I have always wanted to go to Theo's restaurant as I am a huge fan of his and Saturday Kitchen on BBC1 so always enjoy his appearances on the show. The restaurant knew it was my daughters birthday as I had informed them, but we were not expecting the fuss that was made of us. We were put on one of the chef's tables (Matt Tebutt and his wife had the other which just made my night) and Theo greeted us, wished Lily a happy birthday. He had time for everyone in the restaurant, guests were in and out of the kitchen all evening. The waitress we had was just fabulous and we had an absolutely superb evening, one we will be talking about for years to come. We had the Sicily taster menu, 5 courses with wines that accompany the courses. every course was sublime. And at \u00a350 a head, thoroughly affordable for the West End of London. Cannot wait to return, already planning my next visit. And I know I keep thanking him, but thank you Theo, and thank you to all the staff. You really have a great team"

Sea scalop dish come on time from the kitchen but served bit late, hence temperature was not good, it would be much better that it was served on time. Knife for meat dish was with wooden handle which is against HACCP standard. One of the service personnel had scent of cigarettes on his fingers (must say this was noticed when bill was presented, not during food service) All the rest was very good and food was really tasty. Reception was very professional, very good and clean rest room facility. Price wise this was on high end side. Still, I recommend this place."

This was no ordinary experience as this was in a private home with a maximum of 10 guests from anywhere in the world. It turned out that there were only 4 of us last night and all English speaking so it was great. Dan and Henry made us very welcome in their home with a lovely cocktail to start. I could go on but i want to talk about the food. Dan serves 5 courses all paired with different wines. The food was amazing, i don't eat raw fish but last night i could have licked my plate and asked for more. Absolutely delicious. As was the Brussel sprout bisque, again something else i wouldn't eat at home. Griddled white asparagus next with amazing homemade XO sauce. Onto main of Ribeye beef with Peruvian yellow chili sauce and finished off with pear and burnt butter brownie. This meal was truly amazing, everthing beautifully presented,portions are not tiny, glad of the walk back to our apartment. Thanks Dan and Henry for a great night."

A loud music played in the background and everybody are happy. The food is fresh and tasteful and prices are very reasonable. Service was excellent. As pescatarians, we had many food choices. A vegetarian can also find starters and mains he or she can have. Great place, highly recommended."

The main place is not too big but it has additional space at the back and maybe upstairs. The gentleman who served us was very kind. He spoke with us from time to time and made us feel welcome. We took the tasting menu, which was excellent. We needed some adjustments with the food, which wasn\u2019t a problem. The food and deserts were delicious. Together with a very nice bottle of Burgundy, we paid 240 Euros for two people. We will return!"

The duck was the best ever!! and they offered after dinner drinks to accommodate Just be sure to go on a week night"

The prices aren't cheap, but they are in range with the other resorts and restaurants in the area. Would recommend for a nice meal out."

Three \"mains\", two desserts, two sodas and a big bottle of water all for about \u00a315 before tip.  I think we may need to try it again before we leave....."

I had some beef briouates the the chicken tanjia, my wife had the Moroccan salad and then a mixed grill all of which were fabulous and tasty. We finished with Moroccan cakes and mint tea, the latter of which was the best mint tea of our tour so far.  If you want some great Moroccan food slightly away from the noisiest that Jemaa el Fna has to offer, give this place a try."

They picked us up and dropped us off for free from our hotel (we tipped the Tuk Tuk driver though)  The dining room looks as good as the photos and staff are all lovely - smiling and attentive.  Cocktails at $3.25 was too good to miss!  Nice little Spring Roll amuse bouche.  Starters of Fried Noodles and Vegetable Fritters we\u2019re fresh and flavoursome. (6 large fritters)  Mains of Vegetarian Curry and Pan Grilled Beef Steak Lok Lak Style - both delicious!  Lovely home made ice cream and coffee to finish. ($36 + Tip)"

When will we ever learn. This is a restaurant for those with a bucket list to tick off not a true love of food. It was nice enough but formulaic and 'mass produced'. God, the chefs must get bored of cooking Theos 'famous' dishes. We were guests of some friends so just let the evening unfold without any fuss but let me tell you, by the time the waiting staff have finished enthusing about their favourite dishes (the ones they have been told to push) there may as well not be a menu. The pace at which the waitrons poured the relatively expensive wine was outrageous. This was not great service this was rushed. Finally the restaurant is nondescript in the extreme, basically in the basement, and could be anywhere in the world."

The Duetto Sandwich is hard to share but worth every morsel. Ravioli Funghi Salsiccia to die for. Cacio Pepe is a traditional Appulian dish done perfectly. Pachheri Seafood excellent. Patate Limoni and Verdure Grigliate great accompaniments. It is very noisy, but mostly from people talking and having a good time. Spontaneous dancing broke during our meal - just like dining in a local resto in southern Italy."

What I was served was a cold glass of wine. It either not what he showed me or an opened bottle that was in The fridge. Somewhat disappointing. The satay presentation was good - but the chicken was chewy and lacked a proper seasoning. The service was very good."

We just don\u2019t want it to change. The owner is so grounded I hope that won\u2019t be the case and he deserves every success. We visited yet again last Friday and tried the new \u00a320 buffet menu. The tofish we usually love wasn\u2019t available but the owner gave us the most delicious plate of noodles to compensate. The new dishes of guacamole, gazpachio, cashew \u2018cheese\u2019 and mung beans did not disappoint. In fact I think this was the best meal we\u2019ve ever had there. Warm welcomes, lovely service, superb food with sublime flavours... but sssssh... don\u2019t want anyone else to discover it!!!! Sadly, too late!!!"

Lunch is an incredible value, most of full menu options available for only $11, wow. The Sicilian Meatballs are amazing. Staff is all Sicilian, feel like you are there as they are all speaking native. If you want amazing hand made pasta, do go here, do not even think about showing up without a reservation. If you are looking for a quiet, say romantic setting this is not it. However the intimacy adds to the experience."

Also the service is outstanding, nothing spared yet is not over the top. Would highly recommend this establishment. Also $70 for 3 courses of this quality is very good compared to some other similar offerings in the city."

We had an amazing dinner that we will remember for a long time worthy to be celected for an important event.  We went with the tasting menu. I have to mention that the menu is quite rich and many dishes so go hungary since you should not miss any part of it.  The menu starts with amuse bouche with 5-6 items each very tasty giving you a good sense of what to come. It is then followed by fried oysters, octopus and crispy red snapper, then a Korean soup Songee followed by a wonderful Wagyu Tanderloin then a pallette cleanser sorbet then deserts ...  The atmosphere is very pristine, cleanly decorated and very kind and knowledgable service who explain the subtleties of each dish.  It is quite expensive but worth it since it is an experience you will never forget .."

The slow cooked meat melted in your mouth and the potatoes were delicious. Maybe a little more potato is warranted for four people. We thought that, last time we were in Queenstown a few years ago. We did order a salad to go with it and although tasty, was nothing like the salad in the photos online. We would use this venue again. Not a large menu, but a tasty one."

The place is not what you would think from the outside and is very small and intimate. The guys who run it are great fun and very welcoming. The food was amazing and the atmosphere perfect. I would highly recommend anyone to visit and can\u2019t wait to visit again!!"

            "review": "We came to the Be Bop Lobby Bar on a family's recommendation and now we are also recommending it to everyone.  This is a large, light and airy bar in the lobby of the Radisson Blu Hotel. The staff are extremely knowledgeable and very friendly.  They have any drink you could want from wines to cocktails and spirits but they also have a special cocktail menu which runs along the theme of 'be something' ie be an alchemist, be offline, be a Chef, be Woody etc. These cocktails all come with props and some of them are very theatrical but great fun.  We tried quite a few of the cocktails off this menu because it was so good that we visited twice whilst on our trip to Prague. All the staff were really friendly and we got chatting to Jan at the bar on both visits, what a star he is.  My best tips are sit at the bar if you can, order off of the \"Be\" cocktail menu, get involved and have some fun. We are back to Prague this October and will definitely be back in here."

            "review": "We enjoyed our final meal of the holiday here at Rajdoot and were a little apprehensive as all meals so far over the weekend had been very good. I suppose we were just thinking that law of averages would mean at least one poor meal? How wrong we were as we enjoyed probably the best evening of our family break. From the moment we exited the taxi outside the staff were out to greet us, very friendly and made us all feel welcome. You can tell that they all care about their business as they couldn\u2019t do enough for us and even offered us complimentary drinks at the end of the meal. There were all the traditional offerings and some nice specialities too. We had Jalfrezi , chicken saag, and a king prawn korma and I liked the option to have your chicken grilled / tandoori as a opposed to plain. Of course we had poppodums and chutney to start, who doesn\u2019t? All washed down with ice cold Cobra beer. I think everyone was slightly jealous of my wife\u2019s Chicken Saag, not only was it delicious but it came in the hit sizzling pot, which I always feels adds to the experience and I\u2019d encourage them to serve the jalfrezi this way! I\u2019m not sure if this is practical but it certainly makes the table go \u201cooooh\u201d as the sizzling dish approaches. I also liked the fact that when I asked fir my naan bread well done it came nice and crispy just as ordered. Seating was covid friendly and waiters wore face masks so no issues with hygiene/ CV19 To finish off our fabulous evening the waiter allowed my son in law to take away his beautiful cobra glass that he\u2019d been eyeing all evening, which I felt was a lovely touch and made Toms night! Thanks to all the staff at the Rajdoot and I would encourage you to try this place whilst in London. Highly recommended"

            "review": "We\u2019ve eaten at benihanas many times before in various locations and ALWAYS given it a 5* review but this time it barely rated 1* and so I thought that you should know  We booked for 1pm and arranged to meet our son and his wife. We weren\u2019t allowed to sit and enjoy a drink however as we were rushed off to our table with a warning about how soon we would have to vacate the table. Not exactly welcoming  Eventually a waitress came and took a drinks order and gave us menus.  Long wait then she came and took our orders and a while later we finally got a drink. In the us where they live on tips this would never have happened  The chef was Spanish and very difficult to understand. In fact the other three in my party had to ask me what he was saying.  The display was almost non existent. Other benihanas have always put on a real show with food being flicked around, a few ingredients and utensils in the air etc  As for the food each part of the food was served individually so apart from the soup it was all pretty cold  A few selected comments  The fish was tasteless The chicken was dry The prawns were tasteless The rice was tasteless. This was REALLY surprising as we have always rated benihanas as having the best fried rice anywhere.  I\u2019ve never seen egg fried rice cooked this way before. First cook the egg into a well cooked omelette making sure it\u2019s tough. The add the rice. Everywhere else the egg is used to bind the rice  I would have asked for the 12.5% service charge to be replaced by a -12.5% lack of service charge but did not want to make a fuss as the staff seemed distant and just doing their job rather than making an effort to provide a high quality experience for their guests  Hopefully you will find this honest feedback useful in improving your uk offering"

I opted for the 6 course degustation. 3 amuse bousche came first and they were ok. The 1st course was white asparagus. Not a big fan, but it was ok. Seabass followed and it was good and well coordinated with all the other elements. Veal was the main and it was very good. A heavy melted cheese course followed. It was ok but too heavy and cheesy to finish. The strawberry and chocolate desserts finished the set and they were great. Petit fours were also too much for me by then  Service is very good as expected  Pur-fect"

Evidently not an \"IT\" restaurant in paris. I was here 7 -830pm on a friday night and the place was only 20% full. I also felt overdressed wearing a suit with bow tie  Had the award winning duck pate and it was good. The pigeon was commendable too, and traditionally presented. I prefer the pigeon i had at Le Mesure a few days ago  Service was good but i had such a great time with the staff at Le Gabriel earlier during lunch this pales slightly"

Everyone greets you with a smile and you feel very welcome when you step into this amazingly simple eatery. The simplicity ends when the food begins to land on the table. Complex flavours crafted by professionals who really know their food. I was so impressed I returned the next night and tried out even more dishes which was sensational. It would be to match the quality and price of the food here anywhere in Siem Reap. I must for anyone travelling through this city."

The menu is limited, but the food is well prepared, the portions are a perfect size and the tastes are wonderful. We started with the prawns with passion fruit, chili and coriander and were gobsmacked! The taste was perfect - and prawns were served warm. The homemade bread and butter with seasalt was a wonderful addition. For the main I had the veal steak and my partner had the rabbit - which was tender and not dried out! The wine by the glass was good, but served only by the deciliter. And the dessert menu was too limited for us. We would have had a dessert, but they were only two sweet desserts and a cheese plate. We went home to have our own. Would definitely recommend this restaurant and we hope to return!"

It was all cooked perfectly and the combination of tastes was perfect for a cold Bohemian evening. The wine was good by the class, but pricey. The dessert was lovely - but an extra scoop of that lovely ice cream would have made our evening absolutely perfect. Definitely a restaurant to which we will return."

It's an assuming black apartment door that leads up to a beautiful loft  Caters to tourists - but the group was 24 people from Australia, Brazil, US, Canada and Europe  5 course meal of amazing meats each paired with Wine - with great staff and an intimate / closed door feel. I've never had such a cool and unique dining experience in another country!  Luis is onsite and he and his staff make it feel like a big family dinner.  Would HIGHLY recommend. Go hungry - there is SO much food!"

We chose this place due to the positive reviews on Trip Advisor and we were not disappointed. We had the 3 course set menu which was great value. Bill was around $100 with tip for 3 courses and drinks.  Curry I very flavourful but not very hot, starters and appetisers were very nice. A traditional Indian ice cream for desert which was a bit strange at first but very nice. Would recommend for a nice Curry in NY, good central location as well, near Rockefeller Center."

You choose either hot or cold and about 8 mini tasters arrive. All are delicious. We have mains of Lamb tagine and fish fillet and again they were very good.  The setting is lovely and unique. The pool, bamboo and creeping flowers giving it an African cheque feel similar to Senegal. It's more of a courtyard than riad and it benefits from it. If going in the evening book to make sure you are outside, but during the day we were able to just turn up.  The waiters english is not so good, this is very much a French resturant, but you'll not have any problems. The staff were freindly, welcoming and as the resutant emptied they let us sit on and read with mint tea as they reset for the evening around us."

Word of warning, they only do one size, large shoulder roast (with potatoes and gravy). This is enough for two adults or a family. I bought one for myself as I was travelling solo (yay, no wife and kids). It gave me dinner, breakfast and a snack after snowboarding the next day. The flavours were lovely and worked well together. The gravy and potatoes were nice and the lamb was pull apart, melt in your mouth. Do yourself a favour and try this with your friends and family. The site is about a 10 minute stroll from Central Queenstown (Fergburger as a reference) so its easy to get to. A really nice lamb dinner."

I went with the wife and friends this time and had to get them to try it. We ordered a delivery to the hotel for this which cost an extra $8. Well worth it if you don't have a vehicle and don't want to walk to get it. The delivery was spot on time. The lamb was still as tender and melt in you mouth as i'd remembered. Everyone loved it. It served 4 of us nicely. I will definitely be ordering this again next time I am in Queenstown."

Dinner was served by a lovely waitress and all of our pairings were put together by Santiago, one of the owners and a sommelier. The \"closed door\" restaurant was in an unmarked house in Palermo, very charming. We selected the tasting menu ($350 pesos per person) and did 5 wine pairings. At the end we ended up receiving a total of 7 wines including a sparkling wine upon arrival and an extra white from Santiago. The pours were huge and I would highly reconmend doing the pairing (an extra $170 pesos) Dinner was wonderful but be warned we were there for 4.5 hours! You almost needed that much time to drink as much wine as we did! We also got totally wrapped up in a game of \"guess the essence from the sommelier kit\" with Santiago. Even still I wouldn't plan on leaving in much under 4 hours. We were there with friends so it was a great time and the food was fantastic. A very special dinner in BA."

However this is not a stuffy and overly formal dining experience but is contemporarily styled with some left of field options as well as some traditional old favorites. The amuse bouche of warm lobster was a stella beginning to a fabulous evening with lovely pink champagne and moving on to a delightful Provencal ros\u00e9. Dessert was heavenly as was the aged Calvados to finish of perfect evening. Staff were knowledgeable about each dish and very helpful, indeed they welcomed the opportunity to discuss the menu in detail. So price wise its one of those places where if you need to know how much it will cost you can't afford it. Price however should not be a barrier to enjoying a wonderful evening in delightful surroundings. After all what price can you put on a memory that you will never forget?"

She said it was just mint, we\u2019ll when it came to the table (food runner) it had cookies as a garnish and cookies in the shake (think mint chocolate cookies and cream. I know. Yummy!). I was concerned and she said \u201cI checked chef said it\u2019s gluten free\u201d so the kid ate a cookie and started annihilating the shake. About halfway into it our waitress comes back profusely apologizing and said wait. It\u2019s not gluten free. I double checked and chef said \u201cthere might be some gluten in the cookies\u201d so she checked the box for the cookies and they were definitely not GF. I don\u2019t blame her, and was very happy she rechecked and questioned the kitchen and came back to us. I was upset at the cook or chef who should understand the difference between \u201ca little bit of gluten in the cookies\u201d and gluten free. When it\u2019s a medical issue and a dietary restriction not due to a fad or a lifestyle choice it\u2019s a serious matter. The kiddo got a replacement shake and we made it through the night without any major repercussions from the glutening. I do recommend this place still, my burger was A+ just be diligent if you have any dietary issues."

We absolutely loved it, and it was one of the highlights of our trip. We had some of the most amazing food I have ever had in my life here, and we dined with other Americans and Europeans too. Luis and the other hosts were really nice, and the loft itself and the view are great. This is such a different experience and a must-do in Argentina. As others have described, it is a five-course meal with wine for every course. Save your appetites for this! I highly recommend this experience."

One of my fave things to order is the masala dosa, This dish doesn\u2019t disappoint and is always made to perfection. Flavours and presentation 10/10. I also had the dragonfruit smoothie bowl for breakfast yesterday and it looked and tasted so good, went down well with my turmeric latte. The staff are always friendly here and the prices are really good, It also has a beautiful cool breeze always coming through, so nice after the heat outside, I love this place and always come back."

With homemade pastas, friendly wait staff, and a nice wine selection, this restaurant will certainly be one we will come back to. There were five of us, and we each selected something different to try. Everyone loved their selection...from Lobster Ravioli to their version of Lasagna, it was a perfect meal for a cold winter's night. It does get fairly crowded so reservations are highly recommended. And it is fairly intimate table seatings, so probably not the best choice for large groups."

Decent place and we ordered our dishes as well as butter chicken. It tasted nothing like butter chicken and we told the manager about it. I appreciate the fact that they listened to our complain and acknowledged the same. They also took of the charges off our final bill. Other then this everything else was good. Service also has a scope for improvement. Overall I would recommend this place for Indian food."

He saw to us from the moment we arrived straight through to departure and gave excellent recommendations on both food and drinks. The food was incredible. Tbone steak and lobster meal with chips was 10/10 cooked to medium perfection (for me at least) and the cocktails were really delicious. However if you like strong cocktails you may want to ask for an extra shot. But other than that, this place was a good find, and hopefully you get to meet stephan who will add to your experience in a positive way."

All good, they took our number and called us when the table was ready. The food is perfect for sharing, super tasty and great variety. The ribs were incredible!! I've only given it 4 stars because at times service wasn't great... We never got the green tea we ordered and it took a lot to flag down a waiter for more food (despite the place being almost empty by the time we got in). I'd still highly recommend it as a spot to eat though!"

Plae was busy and buzzing, lots of staff to tend to your very need. I had the non-veg Thali which was amazing and my partner had the fish curry, which was also excellent. Food came quickly, was hot and tasty and the prices were reasonable. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this experience and would definitely go back again next time we're in Balham."

The starters we had the celeriac and the lobster which were a delight. the rosemary bread was soft and warm.  The service was fantastic friendly and very attentive.

The restaurant features a regional menu which at \u00a350 including wine is excellent value for money - tonight's was from Emilia Romagna but our prefernce was from the wider A la Carte which is priced by the dish.  Starters of Minestrone and a Cheese souffle were both filling and delicious and mains of Pappardelle and Sea Bream very enjoyable. We finished with a shared Italian cheese course followed by a lovely soft chocolate cake.  The wine list is a lovely tour of Italian regions but there is a nice choice of wines by the glass enabling us to try a selection, the Jermann Pinot Grigio and Planeta Chardonnay both superb examples.  Service was friendly and efficient and we were much more impressed than on our previous visit."

I ordered the mixed grill. The portions were massive. We struggled to finish the food. The room right at the back has 6 or 7 tables. Service is iffy here but the food more than compensates for the bad service. We ordered turkish tea at the end. It took more than 3 reminders and in excess of 30 mins to get the tea. I would recommend you get a table in the main seating area."

The place was beautiful and every detail was looked after in an excellent manner. If you take friends, clients or a date, they will like the ambiance. Parking was a little tough but that's a Dubai issue.  Finally comes the food. It was a mixed bag. The appetizers were above average. The Beryani was pretty good. The rest of the food was average and the Hamour fish was below average. I grew up in Dubai and have had Indian food in many cities around the world. The food here is nothing special. Very unfortunate as it was one of very few restaurants we were able to try during our trip to Dubai and we didn't expect a well appointed restaurant with Indian food in competitive Dubai to have average food.  You can get an idea of pricing from the attached image. The prices, for an American consumer, were very reasonable. Total for 4 people was around $70 (255 AED)."

Pains me to say there seems to be an \u201chonest mistake\u201d scheme running with happy hour. The invoice each time is brought over and they quickly show your free drinks but the total you pay also includes the free. If you question it they then remove the \u201cfree ones\u201d . Every time same problem. When pointed out the 3rd time the waitress got passive aggressive and began being super assertive. It is a classic ruse to gain funds. Don\u2019t begrudge them in this time however check your bill if you care about your happy hour drinks :). Would I go back - sure. Would I trust the bill - no way"

If you have a part of 5 or more, like I did, be ready to wait for an hour or more, especially at dinner time. So keep that in mind. What I saw was a lot of take outs, which is something that I will do next time, instead of dining in and waiting forever. They just don't have the space, and they don't take reservations or call aheads. Other than that, the staff and hostess were great and friendly. The pizza is done right inside brick oven. I believe one pizza would feed two, but if you're really hungry, then just stick with one all for yourself. The price is decent, compared to other NYC restaurants."

The food was inedible in parts and acceptable canteen style food at best which just didn't match the arrogant and often unfriendly wait staff. Besides one very charming, eager young waiter who was happily training his English while working on our Spanish at the same time, there were quite a few older \"supervisor\" type staff members around who mostly did nothing but chit chatting to each other. The meal had wine included and we had even double confirmed in writing that indeed all wine is included but alas, in the end one of these supervisors had nothing else to do but tell us upon leaving that \"only half a bottle per person was included and you drank two bottles in total\". Then he pretended to be super generous by telling us \"But that's okay, for you I will take it off the bill\" clearly fishing for big fat tip. Well- not for that \"my friend\", we left without tipping a single cent on purpose while we had originally intended to leave some money. All in all, extremely disappointing experience."

Mitra was warm, friendly and professional and the food was nothing short of amazing. We had the Momo as a starter which tasted fabulous and I also enjoyed the Paneer Tikki as a main course. Will certainly be returning for other celebrations."

            "review": "A great place for modern Cambodian cuisine. We enjoyed their 6-course tasting menu which we were told changes frequently. Staff were friendly and professional matching the nicely designed place.  Starters were a traditional Cambodian mango sallad with the twist of dried snake. This was followed by a deep fried pork stuffed sticky rice cake served with a fish ceviche dip. Both dishes were traditional yet modern. Precise and fresh flavours.  Main course comprised three dishes: lemon grass spiced fish with a tofu-ginger sauce, a papaya-basil-shrimp soup and curry-peanut fried beef tenderloin. All stretched the flavours in their own way. Together they formed a united, well composed dish.  It all finished with a raspberry sorbet, a sticky rice and sesame seed roll and coconut sago soup. Balanced and tasty.  Only drawback is the lack of a wine pairing meny. So we grabbed all their eight wine-by-the-glass and enjoyed our wine pairing ourselves.  If you are looking for a modern khmer restaurant in a modern and comfortable atmosphere, pick Kroya."

It\u2019s a good location close to the airport but good parking outside too. The owner is so so friendly and welcoming and accommodative. We initially nearly didn\u2019t go because I don\u2019t eat egg but he mentioned they make vegan crepes too with buckwheat! Music to my ears\u2026 I had the veggie burrata, sundries tomato savoury crepe and my partner had the chicken crepe & a Nutella crepe. Must add the sweet potato fries which we had on recommendation are a must! Thank you for a fabulous brunch!"

We sat inside and all the staff were very attentive. I had a mocktail called Anantara which was lovely and my boyfriend had a glass of the Thai Shiraz which was actually good quality.  We didn't have starters but both had sea bass, mine on the rock plate and partners steamed. We were given 3 different salts to have with it which were explained and all went very well!  We had dessert too which was the best sticky rice and mango I've had on the island and we had the banana in coconut which was amazing.  The staff were lovely and the food fabulous. If you are in the Mao khao area it is definitely worth a visit, it's not the cheapest but it is worth the extra money!"

Staff is super great and helpful. Hasan Bey, the manager, is just awesome! And the head chef comes out at least once during the dinner and has a chat with you. And his attire - well kept, ironed, clean. You KNOW the person respects his job.  Everything is great! From salads, to kebabs, to pilafs (PLOV). Anyone in Istanbul - I would definitely recommend visiting."

We chose not to do the wine pairing though and didn\u2019t have the optional cheese course, but there was more than enough food.Service was very good from the welcome at the front door to when we left. Service is included and if you\u2019re choosing not to have the wine paring, there\u2019s a great wine list. We will definitely be going back."

The staff arranged for items off menu that really surprised us in a good way, and the hightlight was the steak - done just right - medium - with really good char on the outside, but still juicy on the inside. They also have an awesome kids menu, which truly made for a good experience for me since we have a young child with us."

Food just perfect (we had 3 courses of classical French cuisine); great wines that were recommended with expertise by the host; cosy, easy-going ambience. But the best of all: What a devoted and personal service. So glad we found this restaurant. We were really happy after this dinner!"

Exhausted from lack of sleep and a short air journey made long by 3 hrs at the airport + 4 hrs of flying, we did our best to salvage our first day with a visit to the National Museum and lunch at Kroya. I emailed the restaurant and requested a table in the air conditioned dining area. Mr. Darin Eang promptly replied to my email and arranged for a quiet table. Service was excellent and the food was delicious. Three diners chose to share Kroya\u2019s version of local Angkor dishes while our 2 gentlemen opted for hamburgers. Our driver Mr. Lim Pengkhun commented that the Fish Amok tasted very authentic. We also loved the raw beef salad.  Thank you again, Darin and restaurant team!"

One of the charms of this restaurant is its location, around a 10 minute walk from the main square through some interesting back streets (mind the speeding mopeds). The restaurant send great directions but if you're a little nervous about finding Pepe Nero they will send someone out to the square to collect you.  The food was delicious and the service was perfect. We chose from both the Moroccan and Italian menus and our friends agreed this was a real gem of a place. Great atmosphere, food and service and the prices are amazing.  So glad we came back and having informed the restaurant at the time of booking that it was our anniversary they supplied a lovely complimentary cake at the end of our meal.  I cannot speak highly enough of this establishment - top class"
