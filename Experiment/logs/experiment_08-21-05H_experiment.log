Edit

Holy guacamole!  I'm a sucker for sports related romances, so I had gotten hooked on Roz Lee's baseball series.  (Check her out here: [...] ) Her fourth in the series just came out a few days ago & I picked it up last night.  H.O.T. !!!  OMG!  So the title is "Bases Loaded (Mustangs Baseball)", and apparently it refers to a "secret club" that these FICTIONAL major league ballplayers have created, where there is a sexual challenge put forth to women who are invited to participate -- and the result for those who make it through all (4) bases is some jewelry pierced into some... um... personal spots.

Anyway - this is the story of Antonio & Clare - Antonio is new to the Dallas Mustangs baseball club and Clare is a college music professor who moonlights as the baseball team's organist.  He catches sight of her at a fundraiser and realizes then & there that she is his soul-mate.  However, she is "curvy" and has massive self-esteem issues, so when he hits on her, she thinks he's being a bully & trying to humiliate her.  The resulting story is how he works through what he thinks are perverted needs for the woman who will bear his children, and she works through her body issues, as they fall in love.  Since it is the off-season, he has lots of free time in which to "woo" Clare.  The ultimate problem?  She wants to "run the bases" for his "Bases Loaded" sex club; he feels too possessive and they have constant clashes over this.  If you want to find out how it all shakes out... READ THE STORY!!!  (Disclaimer:  toy play, anal, m/m/m/f, light bondage.)

Okay, so I'm always a vocalist about digital book pricing, so I will say that this is very well priced for the amount of pages it has - WELL worth the money!!!  This isn't SOLELY sexually based; beyond the character growth of Clare learning to like herself as she is and to realize her inner AND outer beauty, there is a female bully (& don't we ALL know some absolute BITCH who just LIVES to make others feel like crap??!!!??) who threatens public humiliation of Clare and Antonio, which would result in the loss of his contract.  Lots of angst... lots of sex... lots of self-realization that beauty isn't all about Barbie dimensions!

Go read it.  It's awesome.  Just make sure the Partner or BOB is nearby - you may need their "assistance".  [wink]

Then I watched the movie with more interest. It was a very enjoyable long afternoon. Do yourself a favor, get away from all the violence and bad language on tv of these days and put in this movie. It is a very special event.

Twisted Twosome is another winner that had me laughing out loud and craving snack cakes.

A contractor and an heiress.  A man desperate for money and a woman desperate for her independence.  A man with honor and solid work ethics.  A woman with a dream that has champagne taste and a beer budget.  What they have in common is they are both strong willed, smart mouthed, and dedicated to what they believe in.  They say opposites attract and in this case it couldn't be more true.

I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and connected with both of the characters.  Their snarky banter, ridiculous pranks were just part of the pretty package.  Their true hearts and integrity won me over.  Their love for one another had me sighing and swooning.  This book is loosely connected to My Best Friends Ex.  Several of the characters appear in both books.  I cant wait to see what comes next for this hilarious group of friends.  I think Smalls is going to fall hard in a big way!
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: This is a great second chance at love book. There is so much going on in this short story - I absolutely loved it!!!
Davis and Sarah are two very selfless people and I could not think of a better couple that deserve their second chance at love and a HEA.
This is my first book by Caitlyn O'Leary, and I cannot wait to read more from her.
I voluntarily reviewed an advanced readers copy of this book```

I was getting ready to buy the Apple Keyboard for my MacBook but this one works perfectly fine and has the Apple buttons built in. The keyboard recognizes when it is connected to a Mac and activates the specific keys. For the price I really would give this one a chance. It would be nice if it was backlighted but the Apple keyboard isn't either. Definitely recommend this to anyone needing a portable keyboard.```

It was 2 pretty full games in one with a good number of missions and it was neat to see how some of the missions overlap with GTA 4 and the two ELC games overlap with each other.

Personally I like to play games with customizable characters rather than a predetermined one.  I prefer to play as a girl when I can because playing as a guy is a bit strange but I can overlook it in this case.  As with GTA 4, the world is beautiful and realistic, the cars take damage and are neat, its fun to run over things or shoot at things or whatever.  I didn't feel the same emotional connection at the end as I did with GTA 4, but that's okey.  It was a fun couple of games and if you liked GTA 4 (or any of the other GTA games), then I highly recommend it.  Also, you don't need to have GTA 4 to play these.  Its not an expansion, ELC can stand alone on its own.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: I was walking around Notting Hill with my buddy Elias, who runs a biotech company.  "How's work?" I asked, as one does.

He disappeared for a second in the famous bookstore from the Hugh Grant movie and emerged with this thick tome.

"Read this and then we can talk," he said.

The book is a full-on attack on the pharmaceutical industry.  No part of it escapes

The author starts with testing.  In short, negative trials (the kind that say a new treatment did not work) disappear more often than they don't.  This is horrible on a number of levels: 1. It's like rolling the dice a thousand times but only discussing the five hundred best outcomes.  The result won't be representative.  2. People who participate in trials and risk their health to do so deserve better.  3. People who might participate in a similar trial in the future really really deserve better.

Ben Goldacre was not the first to think that this is a problem, and manifold "cures" have been sought/recommended to the problem: medical journals have committed to only publish papers if they can prove they did not "gag" negative results; patients could be warned ahead of participation that the results of the experiment conducted on them might be gagged (though this avenue has not been pursued); professional bodies and regulators have committed to the dissemination of data. The author proves that in practice none of the promises are being kept.  He gives names and addresses.  If he was wrong about the slightest fact he'd be in jail now.  The bottom line is that the pharmaceutical companies carry on with this practice because "he who pays the piper calls the tune" but also because the regulators are both "captured" and highly secretive by nature.  He leaves out a further reason I once read about in another book called "Reasonable Rx," namely that pharmaceutical companies would not under any circumstances want to prevent their competition from going down the same blind alley they just did.  But of course, given how combative the author is and given how many times he points the finger at specific companies he cannot include this criticism, since it is an unprovable allegation.

From the "gagging of negative results" problem he then moves on to the horror of the "Stage 1," "Stage 2" and "Stage 3" trials that bring a molecule from its discovery to the point where regulatory approval (FDA approval in the US) is first sought.  Stage 1 is the business of trying a new drug on people who get paid something like twice the minimum wage to subject themselves to the new molecule.  At this stage the point is merely to find if the drug is harmful, not to see if it cures anything.  The book describes these awful communities of people for whom this can be their sole profession, who more often than not have no medical cover if something goes wrong and who sign their life away before participating, though this is still an improvement on the previous prevalent practice of conducting these tests in jails.  Famous criminal Whitey Bulger was exposed to LSD this way, I seem to recall...

The next two stages are about finding out about how the body absorbs the drug, if it does what it's meant to do with sensible dosage, and of course if it is effective.  Oh, and increasingly many of these trials now take place in super-poor countries around the world, among populations that not only should never be our guinea pigs, but might actually differ significantly in how they absorb drugs.  My wife's from Japan and I'll tell you her body absorbs alcohol very differently than mine does.  CROs (Clinical Research Organizations) are described in some detail too.  These are the companies that conduct the trials.  Once upon a time it was universities, but these days it's private companies, who are in the business of selling the results to the pharmaceutical industry.  No bonus points for guessing what their incentives are.

The laundry list of dirty tricks used in trials by these industry-dependent CROs is breathtaking.  Outright fraud aside (which happens a lot) the tools of the trade include 1. testing on ideal, super-healthy patients, rather than real-world patients who will be often carrying other ailments 2. benchmarking against wrong dosage in the alternative treatment 3. benchmarking against invasive procedures such as surgery over too short a period of time, which will always favour the drug 4. carrying on with catastrophic trials in case they turn 5. trials that are merely large enough to prove something is better than placebo masquerading as trials that are big enough to prove a drug is better than another existing drug, 6. again, typically small trials that are not truly trialling anything and are just marketing ploys to get doctors to prescribe a drug,  7. bundling of outcomes in a way that highlights improvements in the extreme rather than the average 8. scratching from the outcome what happened to patients who dropped out of the trial (when in reality this behaviour can be a good predictor of patients subsequently dropping a drug) if that makes the result look better 9. fishing in the data of failed trials to find out if the drug worked on a (by definition, not statistically big enough) subgroup and, most insidiously, 10. changing your mind ex-post on what you were looking to cure.  Every trick comes with an example from real life.  This is a veritable catalogue of largely legal but ethically highly objectionable behaviour, and if you are remotely human you will be enraged to read about it.  And if one small detail was wrong, Ben Goldacre would be serving hard time.

Regulators also come under the microscope and they don't scrub up too good either.  Quite often, the burden of proof they impose on new drugs is that they must merely beat a placebo rather than the currently "best in class" drug.  Head-to-head tests are as rare as hen's teeth.  Mankind today actually has no idea what the best statin is, for example; no pharmaceutical company has an incentive to run one and no regulator has ever done the work to find out, a fact that statistically speaking has led to millions of premature deaths.  That is not to say there's no room for multiple drugs.  There is, since the statistically most effective drug may have side effects that don't work for all patients.  Regardless, you would have thought there's a duty to establish what the most effective drug is.  It's clearly not how the regulators see it.  Not only that, but regulators allow most new drugs to come to market after proving they can improve a "surrogate outcome" like the cholesterol count, rather than the outcomes that matter like smaller likelihood of heart attack, for example.  In many situations that's the best we can do, of course, but there are circumstances and illnesses where the burden of proof should be much higher.  We also find out about the abusive practices of the industry, which drives drugs through the "accelerated approval" loophole that was carved out for very specific situations.  Again, all of these arguments are made with concrete examples of drugs.  The discussion in this book is NEVER theoretical, it's always via example.  Names and addresses.  And the accusation against the regulators can be summed up as follows: on every issue they are happy with relentless drift toward the lowest common denominator: placebo vs. head-to-head, surrogate outcomes vs. real outcomes and accelerated approval for drugs where we really ought to wait.

The least surprising but longest and most salacious part of the book is to do with marketing.  The author goes quickly over the horrors of direct advertising of drugs to consumers, the websites and fake surveys that invite us to click on to discover if we're suffering, for example, from anxiety etc. etc. and lists tons of studies that prove direct marketing is financially effective and fundamentally wrong, but saves himself for two biggies: the armies of sales reps who have woven themselves into the fabric of the medical industry and the fabrication of company sponsored "research."  The sales reps bit is easy to understand.  It's a bit how bond brokers take me out to dinner, and I love it.  Though of course I would never dream of dealing with them more next morning , needless to say.  It's just the other guys who do that.  My mom believes me, even if you don't.  The research bit is chilling.  Bottom line, pharmaceutical companies plant most research in periodicals.  They employ armies of authors to write the stuff ahead of the launch of new drugs (first a barrage of articles about some new ailment that affects tons of people, then a barrage of articles about promising new medicines) and then literally hire academics to put their name on the ghostwritten research.  This is more insidious than it sounds, because academics benefit doubly from having their name attached to research.  If you only ever sign stuff you wrote you are in unfair competition for promotion, recognition etc. with other doctors who are happy to sign stuff that was ghostwritten for them by a pharmaceutical company.  You obviously miss out on the money too, but that's the lesser of your problems.  Journals turn a blind eye to this, because all the ads they carry are for drugs, of course.  There's nobody watching out here.  Again, Ben Goldacre lists names and addresses, none of this stuff has come off the top of his head.

Bottom line, marketing is 25% of the costs of a pharmaceutical company, research is half of that and the rest is to do with actually making and distributing the drugs!  The author complains that marketing not only is unethical; it also adds a 33% to the price of medicine!

The book closes with a long list of proposals;  summarising solutions the author has been proposing to the specific problems in every chapter.  For example, the NHS has the means to tarck true-world outcomes (not surrogate outcomes) on true-world (non-ideal, superhealthy) patients and has a moral duty to do so, though obviously it needs to overcome the issue of personal data.

He even suggests we start with a South-African style general amnesty, subsequent to which we need to go back and find all the missing studies, find out what data we can collect from existing sources and figure out what tests we urgently need to run.

And since it's the second edition I read, the proposals are followed by a long afterword that lists progress on the proposals which actually sounds quite heartening.

That said, it's INCENTIVES people respond to, and this Ben Goldacre does not address.  The world of pharmaceuticals and medicine needs its incentives to be restructured, or else it's difficult to see how we don't drift back to where we started, and all this after the miscreants have bagged the amnesty!

I must say that after reading this book I can see where the authors of "Reasonable Rx" were coming from when they recommended that the industry be split in two, namely companies that only develop drugs and companies that only market them.  But I still hate their recommendation that a government-supported agency should stand in the middle.  It's not easy, that's for sure.

And now I know a tiny bit more about what was on my friend Elias' mind that day in Notting Hill...```

Perhaps the book would appeal to a different reading audience. I don't care for erotica, vulgarity, and graphic sexual descriptions that have little else going for them. Sorry.

I thought oh no what have I gotten. BUT I was so wrong to be skeptical! I am over joyed with the way these turned out. I LOVE the way you don't even see the screen protector. It was rather slick putting it on and having to wait to lay the sides down was a pain. You get two so, if you mess one up during installation you get a second chance. AND there's a lifetime warranty. The end result was AMAZING! If you are looking for something truly inviable, get this one.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Like everyone else said, NO INSTRUCTIONS except for the labels on each rail - for me though, these labels were enough to figure it out, but I can surly see why so many had problems!
This kit would also be much easier to install if you bought and assembled it WITH the Playseat at the same time, but still took me about 30 minutes to get it on and adjusted - if it binds at all, loosen the 4 bolts to the seat frame and set in the same position on both sides.
I do like this product and it works as intended and it quality made like the Playseats are, BUT it is not installer friendly, so I give it only 2 stars.
RACE ON!```

            ```sample_0: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: In the category of War Films, this one is more of a thriller. James Garner stars as a kidnapped American officer who, while recovering in a military hospital, is led to believe that he is suffering from amnesia.  The key to his recovery is to recall the details of the Allied invasion France.  The twist is that Nazi's actually have him captive and have set up an elaborate charade to convince Garner that the war has been over for years in hopes of discovering the Normandy invasion plans.

Rod Taylor plays the part of a German doctor masquarading as an American doctor attempting to coax memories from Garner.  Taylor's character is very sympathetic to Garner's plight and half heartedly attempts to draw the information from him.  Although Taylor's character is that of a German playing the part of an American, it is difficult to see him as anything but an American.  This is even more suprising as Taylor was Australian.

Eva Marie Saint plays Garner's attending nurse who is torn between assisting Garner and keeping herself out of a concentration camp.

Werner Peters reprises his oft-played role as a Nazi officer. You have seen him play virtually the same role in THE COUNTERFEIT TRAITOR, THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, and THE SECRET WAR OF HARRY FRIGG.  In 36 HOURS he is bent on rushing the carefully scipted amnesia scenario and cracking Garner in order to discover the D-Day invasion plans.  In doing so he shows his true colors as a self serving and glory seeking individual.  He explains this to the German doctor when he blatantly admits that any failure will be blamed on the doctor whereas success will lauded on Peters.

Actor John Banner also makes a pre-Hogan's Heroes appearance in this film. Even though Banner wears a home guard uniform and patrols a fence other than that of Stalag 13, Banner is still lovable Sergeant Schultz.

The plot of this movie has been compared to the elaborate schemes hatched in episodes of Mission Impossible.  In fact, 36 HOURS was remade as a television movie by Ted Turner as BREAKING POINT in the late 1980s.

There was some location shooting in Portugal and additional second unit exterior filming in Germany.  However the bulk of 36 HOURS was filmed in California with exterior shots in nearby Yosemite Park.  Take note of the German army uniforms with the oversized insignia and shiny stahlhelm helmets.  These uniforms were straight out of the MGM wardrobe.  Television series such as COMBAT! also made use of these one-size-fits-all uniforms.

This movie has been difficult to come by even when it was only available in VHS.  In fact prior to acquiring the DVD the last time I saw this movie was on late night television 30 years ago.  Despite reviews about some DVDs with diminished clarity, my copy was intact and absolutely clear.

sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Award-winning and New York Times bestselling author Linda Howard delivers another steamy and heartfelt romance that once you start reading from the very first chapter, you're addicted to the bitter end.  Combined with twists and turns at every corner, this romantic suspense by miss Howard will have you guessing until you reach the shocking conclusion!.......After returning home to the family ranch in Central Florida, a ranch she inherited along with a mountain of bills, Michelle Cabot was shocked to discover that her father borrowed the sum of one hundred thousand dollars from a man she not only despised, but secretly loved for more than a decade.  It was difficult to think of letting the ranch go, and she had almost begun to believe in hope once again that she'd be able to hold on to it, but in that moment, she realized she had failed just like everything else in her life. It was ironic after years of casting insults back and forth at each other, she would now need John Rafferty's good will in order to survive financially to save her cattle ranch, making Michelle realize that she hated him, feared him, and loved him rolled all into one  for a man she knew she could never have , and she knew with a certainty he was nothing but a hell raiser, but mostly, a heartbreaker that could destroy her if she ever gave him a second glance.  Known for having a notorious reputation when it came down to women, rancher John Rafferty was a 6 ' 3" 200 pounds of muscled masculinity, and he was thrilled the little "Ice princess " was begging for his help regarding the money he loaned her father against her ranch, and he had the perfect idea how Michelle could pay back the money she owed him in the most carnal ways, a hunger he felt for years for the one woman he desperately wanted for ten long years, but after he discovered her secrets and the hell she's been through for more than a decade,his first thought was to protect the only woman he ever loved!..........```

            ```sample_0: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: I didn't know part 5 was out. Just happened to come across it. Really hoped and wished Trinity was saved and Rita killed. I can't believe crazy Rita is still alive. She killed Jazzy's baby and forced Maine too sleep with her. Shse left her sick baby and never thought twice about her. She was so foul and deserved a slow painful death. It's like she got away with her crimes. Everyone else got what they deserved., but her.  Why??? Still was not feeling Eric and CeeCee.  Just felt that he should have been with Trinity.  Besides that, loved the series and sad to see it end. Wouldn't mind a part 6. Love Apryl cox's writing style.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: This book had bad me speechless......

I purchased some at Costco a few years back.  The gloves died before I could use them all.  Better to buy the quantity you need than too many and have waste away in the box (fall apart).```

Fans of Urasawa, Death Note (9,5/10) or more fittingly Akumetsu (8,5/10) should like this one and it's follow up. The realistic art is great, the fully fleshed out characters are intriguing and the subject of vigilantism is presented in a critical but though provoking way. The very gritty story could have become preach or dumb really quickly but the author brought his A game and improved an all his earlier flaws. Better Seinen crime manga exist but they are way too infrequent and especially David Fincher fans should like this cyber-thriller.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: I wanted to share the Christmas magic with our grandsons & couldn't wait for these movies to arrive.  As a family we sure have enjoyed these classics.```

Fabric was much thick than I thought and thicker than some of the bathing suits I own.  Impressed with the over all make and sticking done very well. With the thicker fabric it should hold up even when it gets wet, which is nice since it is two toned the blue against the black really stands out...I love the full front criss cross design, esp. on the bottom. I will have to see once it gets wet if the thickness hold up to the water and if the top supports as well as it looks like it shoud... Size was good  on the bottom, a little small on the top...you might want to order a size up from normal. Really wish instead of small, medium, large it was orderable with bra sizes and bottoms like panty sizes.  I have ordered bathing suits in the past that way. I am confident it will still be a hot bathing suit. Can't wait to get to the pool and try it out and not just in front of my bedroom mirror! I did receive this swimsuit in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. I feel I have done that so far and I am happy to come back and give an update
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: I love Dark books like Darklore Manor and others !

We do not like the shipping (that is vendor specific, but fair to point out). More important is the smell everyone speaks of. We have had these for 3 months and the stench (formaldehyde??) is still just as strong. My son now keeps them in the garage, otherwise it stinks up his room.

Because of the smell, I would not buy again.

            ```sample_0: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Janine Ashbless pushes all the right buttons in this exciting follow-up to 2015s "Cover Him With Darkness". I described that first entry in the series as an intense, engaging, grandly imagined, intelligent, entertainingly well-paced and veryverysexy story; erotic romance writ large. I also noted that "Cover Him With Darkness" ...ends with a cliffhanger worthy of "Lord of the Rings", and leaves us breathless for more Its a pleasure, then, to report that "In Bonds of the Earth" is everything fans have been waiting for, taking all the elements that made the first book memorable, artfully supercharging them in a sweeping, action-packed, powerfully erotic story that dazzles with its imaginative employment of real-life settings, elements of ancient lore and legend, and fast-paced contemporary thrillers.

The story is told in first person from the viewpoint of Milja, somewhat wiser now after having freed fallen angel Azazel from eons of bondage, she is doubtful about her lovers plan to release his brothers from their prisons in order to mount a new assault on the forces of heaven. His search leads them to the labyrinth of ancient monolithic rock-cut churches of Lalibela in Ethiopia, where the priests, wielding the rusted relics of saints, guard a secret that humankind must never know. (No spoilers here, but lets just say that the mid-story climaxand Ashbless way of relating itis exciting as all get out!)

The romantic leads are realistically imperfect here; Milja is smart and beautiful, but also still rather nave, not always wise in the ways of humanor angelicbehavior, and still vulnerable where the heartnot to mention her hair-trigger erotic responsesare concerned. She describes Azazel, for all his physical allure, as not very bright, a musclebound creature who lives in the here and now without much thought for consequence or the feelings of others, least of all Miljas.

I wasas everimpressed by Ashbless ability to set her tale within a broad historical and cultural context without resorting to obvious data dumps or dry narrative digressions; the fascinating history of Lalibela is woven so subtly into the fabric of the story as to seem perfectly of a piece with the unfolding adventure. The authors erudition shines through, illuminating the story without ever casting shade on the reader. Miljas informal conversational style does not clash with her obvious intelligence, but brings readers comfortably along, never making them feel patronized or inadequate.

This entry in the series closes with a shattering cliffhanger that will have readers on the edge of their seats, hearts pounding in their throats, and practically howling in half-fulfilled frustration! I felt afterwards as if Id enjoyed an extraordinary meal, richly fed to be sure, yet craving still more, able only to dream of next time.

Well worth the waitand lets hope the wait for the third book won't be too long!"In Bonds of the Earth" is enthusiastically recommended!

Mr hutton shows that claims about the ancient origins of the witchcraft religion are nonsense, but he is always kind and polite, and never ridicules the beliefs of modern wiccans, he must be the world's most tactful historian.  An earlier review of this book claims to have attended a workshop by someone who says she knows of a 'hidden' Pagan village in England, dating back to before the Norman conquest and only discovered in the 1990s.  I don't think this reviewer can ever have been to England.  We are a very small country, with 9as P.J. O'Rourke puts it)'A population density like Macy's toy department at Christmas'.  There aren't any hidden Pagan villages here because there's nowhere to hide them, okay?

Each of the flavors is nearly identical in nutritional value (some slight variation in Iron content from Fruit to Green versions) but otherwise the 70cal snack is perfect for pretty much any time. They are delicious at room temp (or slightly above on hot days) as well as chilled in a refrigerator. For long hikes I'll freeze overnight and let it thaw out - still delicious.

As for the Green flavor this is much better than most "green" things. There is still sugar naturally packed in here from the fruit but there is a bit of a tang that reminds you it is a green packet and not the Apple Cinnamon, Strawberry Banana, or one of the other even sweeter flavors.

The 8 Pack cases come in easy to tear apart boxes so you can place the container on a counter or in a pantry for easy grab and go access.

Packaging design has a bit of "kid food" to it and makes them fun to eat, though there is always just a little bit left in the nozzle. This leaves me wanting for more.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: talk about beautiful! I've been looking forward to this ring. It doesn't fit- it's sized small but it is beautiful. The Irish clauddagh is beautiful with great detail and the band is beautiful with it. The metal is very shiny and the blue is a deep sapphire blue. The heart is for love the crown for loyalty and  the hands are for friendship. It's a perfect set- just wish it fit. I might give this one as a present and bu a larger size for myself. It really sparkles in the light. I received this product at a discount for a fair and unbiased review. I try to be as honest as possible- I rely on reviews to make purchases.```

sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: The book started out wit the Demons, and their problems and how they try to fix them. Big mistake. Now there is a sword out there that craves the souls of these demons. Nice start.

What I really enjoyed, was how the demons are portrayed, Not as a soul craving, bent on destruction, totally evil creature, but as normal, common 'people'. They have their good and bad. They have their social divisions. They have slaves. You get the idea. The first part of the book sets up the demon society and problems faced.

Second part of this book is in the present, and in the human lands. You get introduced to many great characters that will be prevalent thru out the series.

Lot of action, great character development, and a fantastic plot. Yes, save the Kingdom from the impending massive army. Shit crazy evil wizard's. A wonderful cast of supporting characters and plots.

Needs a bit of editing, but otherwise, great read.```

sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: It's time to visit the works of an excellent teller of tales. Hopefully a good number of you readers recognize the name Michael Crichton, and are familiar with his body of work, as it is rather extensive and his untimely passing in 2008 came as a massive shock and resulted in extensive news coverage. For some of those who are taking the first step toward this man's creations, welcome! Come prepared for a journey into a scientific mind, intelligence and articulate with narrative. Bring you into the world known as the Congo. it seems only appropriate that I share a quote from the late, famed explorer, Henry Morton Stanley. "The more experience and insight I obtain into human nature, the more convinced do I become that the greater portion of a man is purely animal."

The Congo... a dark territory filled with the unorthodox, many things foreign to civilized man, boasts promises of potential rewards. It also awaits our focal group, who are about to embark on an extremely hazardous trip. After receiving a horrifying video-taped distress call from a team of explorers, a new group are sent on a rescue/discovery mission to find out precisely what's happened. Once in the Congo, we begin to discover just how dire this situation was and unfortunately still is. Examining footage of the missing team's desperate pleas for aid reveals what appears to be some type of creature of devastating strength. But this second expedition have more than a single goal in mind, the missing are just one bit of this trek.

We find ourselves involved with quite a variation of characters, each harboring different motivations. On this exploration we have Peter Elliot, a zoologist who has brought along Amy. Amy being a bright young gorilla that communicates with humans through American sign language. Her purpose is to help understand some of things that have been seen on the tape and to let her experience what her natural habitat is like, give her a taste of liberation. Along with a crew of African helpers, we meet their superior, Munro. Munro's an expedition leader with a questionable character, but uncanny talents that often prove quite valuable during their treacherous trip. Then there's Ross, a woman working for the government with an agenda she has no intentions of sharing. Not to be ignored are the pigmy tribe,who are actually of help to the travelers. Prepare for a consortium of foreigners fighting for power and trying to beat Ross to the same mysterious thing she searches for. For the most part, these are the key players to deal with in Congo. However, there are two other elements to this list that must be remembered since they make for the novel's true horror. First, The Kigani Tribe, a cannibalistic group always on the search for victims and second, the unknown protagonist seen on film. These creatures appear as though they leapt straight from a nightmare; as Amy would say "like a gorilla but not a gorilla...a bad thing." You've met our crew: it's up to you whether or not you'd like to invest the time in getting to know these personalities, their mishaps...horrors ...and deaths.

Get a look at Amy - who plays a rather pivotal role in this story - onscreen, in the 1995 film directed by Frank Marshall.

congo+1995

Not long after beginning to read this novel, memories of viewing the movie years ago swarmed the mind. I definitely recommend the original format over Frank Marshall's cinematic adaptation. This is a science based horror story that injects some exaggeration, but maintains a lot of fact as well. It most definitely contains terror and horror, but Crichton plays classy and keeps the gore a distant, underlying element of the tale, rather than an in-your-face piece of the puzzle that cannot be ignored. So, I suggest if you choose to read this book, you do so knowing that you're in store for far more of a biological thriller than a blood and guts creature trope.

At the end of the day, I'm choosing to hold back just a tad on the rating of this book, but there's a personal reason for that, and I'll explain: I give Congo a 3.5 rating, but my rating would no doubt be higher if not for the fact that sometimes Mr. Crichton incorporates a bit more technology in his novels than I care to know about. In this day and age however, that will more than likely be embraced by a good many readers, since it's obviously a technology fueled society we occupy today.

Turns out, she has been on a Keto diet! About a week later I got the opportunity to read this book and I am psyched to try it out! The book includes a very easy to understand explanation of the diet and how/why it works. At first I thought it was just the Atkins diet re-named, but it is SO much more than that! While the thought of giving up pasta and bread is scary, the book gives some delicious sounding alternatives. There are so many yummy sounding recipes that I can't wait to try, and share with my friend. In fact, I have decided to order the paperback so I can add my own personal notes, dog-ear the pages and browse thru it like it is a Christmas wish book!
I received this product exchange for my honest unbiased review.

I've only had it a couple of days and I'm conditioning the batteries.  They seem to last about 2 hours when left on continuously...pretty weak the last 10 minutes.

It does come with the piggyback charger and an extra battery, but I'm at a loss regarding the rapid charge and different modes of brightness.  There aren't any options on the charger or flashlight for those.

In any event, this is the most powerful battery I have ever used.  Just be careful you don't hurt someone.

Flashlights have come a long way since the early 80's when we were issued a huge plastic flashlight that took 4 "D" cell batteries and maybe provided 3% of what the Streamlight produces.  And we replaced the batteries at the beginning of our shift each night.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: This worked perfectly.  It was very easy to use.  We had bought a splitter because of past experience where using one of these is a total PITA, but this was so easy on and off that we didn't even take the splitter out of the package.  If you need to use a normal water hose in your kitchen, this is very possibly your best bet.```

sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Ruin and Rising a book that I was debating on how I felt going into it. I was excited for another Leigh Bardugo book, but after the ending of Siege and Storm I had doubts on the direction this book would lead me. So I wasn't all that hyped going into it as I had been for Siege and Storm, but that didn't deter me from the plot and the twists and turns that Leigh Bardugo throws at her readers. The story was complex and at times it was heart-wrenching. While I didn't agree with the ending entirely, it was warm and cozy and just plain enjoyable.

  The book picks up shortly after the end of Siege and Storm with maybe a few days/months having past. Alina's recovering in the midst of the Apparat and his nearly completely delusional zealots who worship as if she's a god. Alina has no interest in being their worshiping figure, but wants to give them freedom from not only the Darkling but anyone who wants the power he possess. Which is one thing that keeps coming back to me over and over with Alina; she tends to react for the greater good before thinking about herself. It occurs more often than anything in this book, which is more heroic and saint-like than what she thinks.

  Alina and Mal are on the hunt for the phoenix to complete Morozova's color, and while she they are searching for it, the Darkling is on their tail nearly at every turn. The Darkling has declared nearly all out war on anyone affiliated with Alina and Nikolai. I find that there wasn't enough Darkling in this book. He wasn't a villain more of an evil guy that just happens to show up at random times. Yea there are some visions and insights into him, but there it just never added up to gain an attachment or fear him at all.

  Now Nikolai was a figure that while being the sassy attractive figure that everyone grew to love in Siege and Storm. However in Ruin and Rising he just falls sort of his normal attachment. I rarely found that he was trying to win Alina over like previous and was more of that creepy guy hanging out in the bushes. But further when he gets involved with the Darkling the outcome just leaves him a shell of who he was. For a good part of the book he was the light, the comic relief of the book and by removing that the book just got dark and depressing. It needed Nikolai, and far far more of his light heartedness.

  Getting on with Mal, there was just not enough of him to really comment on that anyone who read the first book wouldn't already know. The character growth for Mal was what he was in the beginning, being the sword that will fight for Alina. While that is at times costly, it just keeps Mal locked into one roll that cannot and will not change. I find Mal likable and would have preferred to see what he could have done if he didn't need to find that phoenix for Alina. It was just so tragic to see a preferred love interest just get locked into one spot and not allowed to deviate.

  The world in this book is generally the same. The beginning of the novel is rather lackluster tunnel system, that is more confusing than anything else. I wanted more out of this, some sort of way to tell what is going on inside the tunnels. Outside and in the normal world which is the rest of the book, it was all similar to the previous parts of the series. Ruin and Rising just rinsed and repeated what's already been done. There was a new outpost with Nikolai and the little journey to find the Phoenix. But at the same time, so much of the book was reused and rehashed, that it just stole from what hope was there.

  I would say that this book was an easy book to rate and deserves the rating it got. However, when I started writing this review and even in my notes I have it done for a solid 4.0 rating. The reason it got lowered is after typing up some of the notes and the comments I had on the characters and how the world just wasn't there. I found that the title lives up to the plot. The first two were decent to great, but this just seemed to fall where Siege and Storm left off. Its sad to say, I am not sure what could have been done to make this book better other than to just start over. It just fell flat.```

keep getting better.
I have been asked for awhile, to review Fatal Seance,
and, have just now gotten to it.
The reader feels like they are in the small town of
Brinnon Washington, with their small Sheriff's Dept.
In this story, the town has hired a Carnival, to include
a Gypsy fortune teller, for it's annual Fall Festival, that
lasts for 3 days, ending right before Halloween.
It seems that a 12 year old boy, from Salem Oregon, has
sneaked into town with the carnival, and he is a runaway.
A body is found, having the same last name as the boy,
there are drugs missing, and the person has been shot.
The carnival's fortune teller, delivers a dire warning, that
a child will be harmed, and then she can no longer be found.
The boys Mother has broken out of drug rehab, and is on her
way to Brinnon to get him.
But, you do not need a Ouija board to find out what happens,
it is all in the book.
This is a quick afternoon read.......Enjoy.
Oh BTW........Sarah and Dave have a surprise for you.```

sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Beautiful! A super weight to make headpins and works really well for wire wrapping. This gauge fits well through most beads and because it is half hard, it retains shape. This wire shines up beautifully. I will definitely order this again - and I will get it from uGems. Packaged in a nice cardboard envelope so the wire arrives safely. This was available at an amazing price - and I'm still shocked at how quickly it arrived!

Every silver tarnishes (due to air and light) - wash it with soap and a little soap, drying it with a clean, soft cloth. That should help. You can also buy little strips that will prevent tarnish - and they are only a couple of dollars for ten.```

            ```sample_0: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: This author seems to have the same sexual fantasy as this is the 3rd or 4th novel where the sex scenes have been the same.  I couldn't really get into the characters this time round.  But I have to say I'll still buy novels from this author as I absolutely loved Deviant and hope she writes more like that.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: William Thorne cant remember who sent him to kill Holly Evernight. But she is the reason to blame for his current condition. His body is slowly turning to platinum, because of the blasted clockwork heart Miss Evernight put into him. Now, he has to figure out how to save the woman who is his enemy so they can figure out together how they can save his life.

Ill be honest, I wasn't sure what to expect. While I really fell in love with a lot of the characters so far in the Darkest London series, it had been a while since I read the last one. And these two characters were introduced in the last book Shadowdance. So I went back and read the last few chapters of Shadowdance to re-familiarize myself with their story and characters. Im glad I did because I think this added to my overall enjoyment of Evernight.

I really like Holly Evernight. Shes brilliant inventor and social recluse. I genuinely enjoyed her. Her dry sense of humor and stubborness is endearing. She reminds me of a friend I have, actually, who is slightly socially awkward. Shes a lot of fun to read, especially in most of her scenes with Thorne, who loves to push her buttons and get a rise out of her. Thorne is a classic boy hero. He would pull her pigtails if she had them. He pushes her on, needles her with his wit and charm. Its a sweet romance with two very well developed characters.

The story is interesting with a lot of layers and multi player motivations. It kept me guessing till the very end. That said, I am slightly disappointed by the way it all turned out. I mean, of course I want the HEA, but it felt rushed towards the end and then BOOM. Suddenly, all these things that had been plaguing the characters from the beginning all turned out to be fine with not a real solid solution. Shrug. I don't know. Im being picky.

Some familiar characters pop up again in this latest installment, but we don't really get a lot of whats going on outside of Holly and Thorne. I would love to get a little more continuation on favorite characters like Miranda and Archer etc.

I cant wait to read the next one because it sounds like it will be about Eliza May and Adam. Wow. That sounds super intriguing.

Overall, Evernight is a fun story filled with magic, romance and the best parts of Darkest London.```

It's helping me with my Bellatrix Lestrange costume and it's been great! I love that I can use it for a while and sometimes, not get a bright color on the fabric then pump the paint through the tip and get a really bold/bright color. So I can get the best of both worlds without having to use different colors or markers. I'm using it for the swirls on Bellatrix top and skirt and sometimes they aren't always bright and obvious and this marker is allowing me to get the job done =)

Raw API response: Here are the predicted scores for the provided samples in JSON format:

```json
{
  "sample_0": 4,
  "sample_1": 2
}
```

Based on the content of the reviews, here are the predicted scores:

- `sample_0`: 4 - The review is generally positive, mentioning the affordability and utility of the Avery Binder for the reviewer's social media and blogging schedule. The only downside mentioned is the limited color options, which is a minor concern compared to the overall positive experience.
- `sample_1`: 2 - The review is less positive, expressing disappointment that the product (presumably a toy plane) didn't meet the reviewer's expectations. The reviewer's excitement and expectations were not met, and they mention that even their toddler did not find it engaging. This negative experience and the reference to wasted money suggest a lower rating.

No one knows where and when we are to find the person we are destined to be with.  Until that moment happens we are to reflect the reasons on why and how it happenes.
Chloe, a high achieving and remarkable law student is busy living her life in the world of studies.  Her and her finance Franklin are a very happy couple and though they are very busy, they are looking forward to graduating and starting a life together.  Until one fateful night,  Chloe's world comes to a major hault and things she never knew come to surface.  Does she really know the person she holds so close to her heart?  Was he the right one?
Fisher is every girls dream. A Hot, hard working, family oriented, head on his shoulders work boot wearing country boy.  Working long days and from a small town where everyone knows everybody, he hasn't found the right one to share his heart with.
Chloe and Fisher are linked some how with a fateful accident.  Who is Fisher and how does chloe and his world collide, is for you to find out.
This was my first book I've read from Dekota Madison and was delighted to read. I was very intrigued from the start.  I had no idea what was going to happen. I will not lie I was thinking of so many senerios from the major shock factor in chapter one! I had no idea what was about to unfold!  To be honest I was a little taken back, but I read for emotion and as I read more and not understanding how this can happen...it does happen and who am I to judge.  We fall in love in all different ways. I wish we saw more internal feelings from Chloe though, I feel like she was holding back to much. So once I was over the whole situation, not being very happy with Franklin and chole, I continued on and I was pleasantly pleased.  Having such feelings awaken me in a story is a good thing. I loved how we were brought into such  heartwarming scenery. The little town where Fisher lived,the hangouts and the friendly people. Dakota Madison writes with such ease and flow for a sweet aftertoon read.  The title fits this story perfectly. I love the whole meaning and the deadication for this book.  I feel there is Somone out there for everyone, and finding them is all up to hands we are dealt.  It's all about what makes us happy and in love, and not always how it started.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Yet another prison movie with a very basic "plot": Eddie Furlong is jailed on marijuana charges and is taken under the wing of fellow inmate Willem Dafoe (in another excellent performance) as his protege. The movie is directed by actor Steve Buscemi; who also has a cameo. ANIMAL FACTORY is based on the semi-autobiographical novel by Buscemi's RESERVOIR DOGS costar Eddie Bunker. As with almost all prison movies the objective is to escape from the place. One famous sequence from Peckinpah's THE GETAWAY is even ripped off at the movie's climax- and undermines what is otherwise a first class prison flick. Yet another seemingly tacked-on ending.
There were a couple of inspired scenes which appealed to my warped sensibilities: Dafoe and Furlong having a conversation via toilet during their placement in solitary confinement; and the tasteful scene where Dafoe slits his wrists, sprays blood all over himself and eats his own doodoo. Nice.
Tom Arnold also stands out as a hillbilly who wants to get chummy with Eddie, and scariest of all, Mickey Rourke "as you've never seen him before" as Jan The Transexual. It would be better for most film fans if we never see him again, and yup, Mickster gets to say his favourite compound word. His mother must be very proud of him.```

            ```sample_0: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Nutshell review: I found Draw Buildings and Cities in 15 Minutes to be a helpful guide to getting started for those of us who are complete beginners. Don't expect to draw anything in 15 minutes, at least not at first. The author admits it may take practice times of up to one hour each before becoming comfortable with drawing buildings. With enough practice, I can expect to eventually complete a picture in about 15 minutes.

The information really is helpful to complete novices such as myself. The book explains everything from different types of lead, how to choose a subject, and details to look for when sketching. The 'look inside' feature above shows a good example of what's inside.

Overall, I found this book useful.

But seemingly the killings are each carried out differently not making any sense.  Thinking that there are more than one killer but things are not as they seem.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: The books a bit rocky at first, the writing a bit stiff.  But very soon it hits its stride and I noticed nothing else negative.  The book is extremely intense, the tension building evenly to the climax.  I had guessed a bit wrong where she was going, but the plots final twists, while somewhat unlikely, were all ultimately satisfying and internally consistent.  The pacing was good, consistently building tension but also with lower intensity moments to catch your breath.

I found the protagonist to be satisfyingly complex and relatable, and the same for the supporting cast, more or less.  One of the bit players I particularly liked and was glad to read her fate.  There are a couple side mysteries not cleared up, but they are left in such a fashion as to actually improve the story.

The book is a naked argument against capital punishment, so if that bothers you, stay away.  I remain strongly pro-death penalty, but its preachiness didn't bother me; I think we should all keep in mind the inherent human weaknesses in the system.  We have a legal system, not a justice system, and we cant un-execute a convict.```

- `sample_1`: 5 - The review is highly positive, emphasizing that the book is excellent and much better than the movie adaptation. The recommendation to read the book before watching the movie contributes to a high rating.

sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Growing up in the church world, it was commonplace to hear people tell God that they would be willing to give up anything for him. For all that I know, I would say my odds of doing this would be quite high with all the youth camps, revivals, and countless relationships that needed mending. "God, I'll give up anything you ask me as long as you let this one person hate me less," would often be my words. If we are being honest with our heart, we know that it happens all the time.

I have made a concentrated effort to start reading books written by women. I have nothing against women authors, it is the simple feeling that I could relate to men better. While that is a true statement, I took a chance and could not be happier. The words of Anything by Jennie Allen wrecked my world. It seemed as if she was speaking directly into the situation that I had found myself in for a specific season of life.

I had told God that I would gladly give up anything for him to use me, but what happened when he took those things away? What happened when things in my life were removed by force? Could I still cling to the word "anything" when we were ecstatic with news of a baby only to suffer a miscarriage? Were my words true even when I lost my job? Could it be that I really didn't mean anything, but rather I wanted to bargain to God for an anything but scenario?

Hear me out before we get too much farther, I don't believe God took the baby from Leighann and I but rather things happen as a result of this fallen world we live in and there is nothing we could do to change that. The job, on the other hand, could have been God answering a prayer. I had prayed for God to provide a way out of the company I worked for and He provided, just not in the way I wanted. There are things we will never know this side of Heaven and even there some questions will be left unanswered. I try not to think about those things.

Jennie tells her story of how she came to say yes to anything. She also goes on to recount the times that God has asked her family to say yes to giving something up for his glory and the struggle of continuing to do this. Like Jennie, I would not say that it has always been easy process, but the payoff has been spectacular. Through the encouragement and challenge she provides, I have learned to give things up when God asks rather than holding on to them. I have learned that what we need will be provided in due time.

If you have not read this book, please do. The impact it will have on your life will be one that will last decades.

As a side note, I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an unbiased review. The words contained in this review are my own and have not been manipulated by the publisher in any way.```

Rip can be read as a stand alone, however it is a spinoff from the Eagle Elite Series. RVD does an excellent job of recapping events, so a new reader to the series would not feel left out or confused in any manner. It's a ideal opportunity for those wanting to dive into the series. Anytime I can see my mafia guys, I am thrilled.

Sometimes the most terrifying things you will ever encounter are also the most beautiful.

The first chapter is intense to say the least and sets the tone for the entire book. It is enthralling from the beginning moments until the last chapter. There are subtle clues throughout, but RVD does an impressive job with leaving you wondering what is truly transpiring. I had at least two or three theories going at anytime and was constantly changing what I thought after each chapter. Nikolai is intriguing and it took the majority of the book to fully understand and appreciate his character. He is definitely a mystery and unlike most of RVD's usual main characters. Maya was fascinating as well, and I found her to be likable. Her father and his darkness seemed to only make her stronger. Nik and Maya's chemistry was intense, but more of a slow burn. I loved the angst between them as all the clues fell into place about their relationship.

"The scars you can't prove are usually the ones that hurt the most."

While this book has darker elements for RVD, this by no means a "dark read". The most powerful element is definitely the suspense. You have to be patient and let the story slowly unfold. It's also a perfect book to reread or skim back over, so you can pick up all the clues that were left behind or missed the first read through. Of course, it was exciting to see my favorites from Eagle Elite. They are true to their usual style of humor and toughness. I recommend this one to any suspense/romance lover and a must read for any Eagle Elite fan.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Kasey Chambers is a gem.....
  A real life keeper.....
  A incredible easy listening and fine artist. I found her by accident while listening to the Emmy's several years ago,
  Her voice was doing back grounds for a performer. She was way in the back but man that voice was impossible not to be drawn to......

After spending weeks looking through the credits on the Emmy's I found the name for that voice.  It was Kasey Chambers and Wow what a find...
  She was raised in the Aussie Out back by her families who were hunters of Fox and Rabbits and somehow we were lucky enough to get her to America. She must have had one hell of a Agent to get her to us,. But I am glad she made the trip

My favorite CD of hers is called the "Captain" while you are ordering this CD which is also great order the Captain....
I own all of her music and she has nothing below a 5..... This lady and her family are terrific..

She in my opinion will go down in History along with Etta and many of our other fine female Blues Best of the Bests......
So now that you know what I think of her what's holding ya up?
Buy some of her music
 Buy her she is truly very cool.....```

            ```sample_0: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: This is a well-crafted book, melding the childhood relationship of two friends, the adult development of one of them (the narrator) who has trouble finding herself and her power in relationships, and fame in the worlds of dance and music. Relationships with their mothers and fathers are also important for both of the two friends. The narrator is a likable but frustrating character who seems too malleable. Her friend, her mother, and later her famous boss, have too much power over her, which is not a traditional gender submissiveness because the person with power also is a woman, and the narrator is uncomfortable with her malleability. Her lack of growth through much of the book is frustrating. Race also matters to the story as both the narrator and her friend are half black and half white, growing up in London housing projects. This is a good book for being pushed to take another perspective, and my feminist reading group had a great discussion of it. On the other hand, it is not really pleasant reading and can be slow going at times.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: This book (and the last) were a drag. This author needs some serious editing! Seems like he is getting lost in the descriptive part of the narrative and the thrust and direction are too diluted by far. Also, we are running out of original protagonists, and I find myself becoming detached from the characters. There are only two I care about any more, and it is getting hard to wade through pages and pages of descriptive nothingness to keep up with them. Not sure I will continue with the series. I feel kind of abused!```

sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Tom Bird really knows how to reach inside the heart of a budding writing and draw out the Divine Author Within. His extensive personal research on the craft of writing is fused with a deeply thoughtful approach to awaken the inner muse and keep the ideas flowing. He proves that setting time limits and expectations for writing, then taking time to clear your mind and open yourself to rapid inspiration is the best way to give birth to a novel. Get the ideas out there. Get the words on paper so they can be real.

Tom teaches techniques for letting go of the critical logical mind and giving the CREATIVE mind permission to be free. He shows how to live up to your highest potential, not just in writing, but to use these simple guidelines to bring out the best in all aspects of your life. Written with tons of quotes from famous authors, leaders, and creative minds that show that his way of thinking has been implemented by successful people for a long time. Creativity needs to flow. Stop thinking, and LET IT GO.

I did not purchase the additional audio CD that goes with this book, but wish I had it for my own writing. On it, Tom describes that the CD helps relax the mind, center your thoughts, then provides a soothing background to listen to as your writing. I would love to try it. Tom also offers retreats where participants go to ACTUALLY write their book in a weekend. It sounded fantastic!

A must read for all aspiring writers. I highly recommend absorbing the knowledge and wisdom that Tom Bird has given in this book and applying it to your own creative endeavors.```

Unlike most of the reviewers so far I just didn't find it funny and maybe it plays better if you are from the US.

sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: After month upon month of searching every record store in the tri-county area, I finally came upon "Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Silence" in a local record store in December. Well, a month later, I find myself listening to this more than any other CD I own. Glassjaw have (somehow) managed to strike a chord in my own personality. They have their finger on the pulse of what my life is like today. I haven't been able to relate to and get so much out of a band in so long. I have been listening to it just about 3 times a day, and it still sends shivers down my spine. The emotion in Daryl's lyrics and his singing voice are the perfect combination. The sound produced on here is really refreshing, in a year where everyone was trying to be as heavy as possible. Undoubtedly the best debut of the past few years. "Pretty Lush" is the best track on here, with the infamous line "I wish you a broken heart, and a Happy New Year." The whole CD is just laced with lines like that. "Hurting and Shoving" is another standout, the heaviest, no doubt, and another song that just fills that kind of musical gap that has been left wide open for the last few years as far as new bands go. "Majour" is just nothing but heaven--even from the opening lines to the end. A lot like the Deftones, Glassjaw use violent imagery while painting a beautiful picture, which in my mind, Daryl excutes just as well. Maybe it's his voice, a Tom Yorke/Chino Moreno/Elvis Costello hybrid, I don't know. But the honest truth is, you would be denying yourself one of the best musical experiences of your life if you did not get this CD. It has touched me in so many ways that I can't even explain. Please, I urge anyone who is reading this and doesn't own the disc, go out and buy it. It is well worth it.```

We have had this game set for a few months now and its a game both of my boys go back to time and again even when they get new games. I love the option of buying new characters so that the game changes up and opens more. The graphics are great and it's easily one of the favorites in this house.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Bars looked like they had been around the block a few times when I unboxed them, no damage or scratches, but there were rub marks on the ski bars, and the box containing piece was crushed. I was able to rub the marks that were on the bars to satisfactory "new looking" condition.

I have had no problems with slippage of the arm rests or bars as other have mentioned, I did tighten pretty hard however. This is my second set of aero bars, the first set was a knock off brand (almost identical to the Profile design T2+) and one of the J brackets broke when I was trying to "adjust" the arm rest up after miles of use. Do yourself a favor and just loosen the allen bolt to make adjustments and don't strong arm it into position. This can lead to a broken bracket and a costly fix.

As far as the T1/2/3/4/5 goes, I would have liked the T3+ bend option more than the T1+ because it has the dip just before the final bend, making it slightly more comfortable on your wrist, but they cost almost twice as much. My old set was identical to the T2+ bend option, I liked it as well, but I do like the T1+ more than the T2+ bend option after trying both out now. All are only my personal preference, but I would rate them T3+, T1+, T2+ T4+ T5+ in order of comfort.

The level of customization this line of aero bars offer is amazing, and if you cannot find a comfortable riding position with them, you will probably not be able to find aero bars that work for you. Everyone is different, and you will probably not set up your bars the same as someone else, so if you think you may want to try out some, the T1+ offers a great bar set at a very good price, on sale:).```

In the past Michelin's lasted for ever and I hope these do also. Only had a couple rides on them so far, but the ride is great and the tires grip nice in the corners.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: One day I was in a store and heard some music that caught my attention.  I asked the store owner what I was listening to.  It was "Ojala Que Llueva Caf" by Juan Luis Guerra.  At the music store I asked for help in finding it.  "That's a good one, but `Ni Es Lo Mismo Ni Es Igual' sells a lot more."  So I bought both and was glad I did.  They are both full of lively happy music.  When I bought "Para Ti" I was blown away by the music.  JLG is a great writer, fine singer, and has a wonderful supporting cast of musicians.  I listen to it again and again, not understanding the lyrics, but lost in the joyful sound.```

            ```sample_0: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Roddy (Hugh Jackman), a pet rat living in a posh house in Kensington, London, wakes up one morning to find the little girl who cares for him has gone on vacation, leaving him enough food for a month. With the house to himself, he makes a checklist of fun activities and uses the girl's other toys as companions. Later, that same evening, Roddy awakes to a strange noise and arrives in the kitchen just in time to see Sid (Shane Richie), a fat sewer rat, explode through the kitchen plumbing. When Sid realizes where he is, he quickly makes himself comfortable. Roddy is aghast at the messy intruder and comes up with a way to get rid of him. Offering his guest a Jacuzzi bath, he shows him the toilet. Sid is all for the Jacuzzi, but turns the tables on Roddy who is soon flushed away. In the sewers, the pet rat finds a miniature London populated by sewer rats, frogs and slugs. He soon meets Rita (Kate Winslet), the tough as nails skipper of a little schooner. She is wanted by the Toad (Sir Ian McKellan), the local gangster with  a brood of rat henchmen, including Whitey (Bill Nighy), a former laboratory rat who is now an albino and Spike (Andy Serkis, the Gollum in "The Lord of the Rings"), Whitey's none too bright accomplice. The Toad has a master plan and wants the ruby Rita stole from him. When they retrieve that, Rita quickly grabs the "Master Cable", the Toad's method of controlling the flood gate into their world. Rita and Roddy form an uneasy alliance to escape and set things right.

"Flushed Away" is a CGI Animated film from the same people who brought us the "Wallace and Gromit" films and "Shrek". If you are familiar with Wallace and Gromit, you probably know they are animated using an old fashioned technique; Claymation. The figures are made out of clay and they are moved and changed for every single frame, giving them a rounded look and making them appear three dimensional. You also frequently see thumbprints and imperfections as the characters move and change, but this is part of the charm for this type of animation.

In "Wallace and Gromit and the Curse of the Were-rabbit", the filmmakers developed a new software program allowing them to animate the bunnies floating around in the Bun-Vac 6000, while retaining the same look of Claymation. This software was used to make all of "Flushed Away". Essentially, the entire film is created with CGI, but the software maintains certain imperfections and shows us an occasional thumbprint. It is an interesting idea and works well. Perhaps too well. I'm sure this new software allows for a faster production schedule, but it also allows the filmmakers to create larger, more complicated landscapes. This robs this type of animation of intimacy. In "Curse of the Were-rabbit", it was more than a little endearing to see Wallace and Gromit's little British village come to life. In "Flushed Away", Roddy enters a miniature London, complete with replicas of the London Bridge, Big Ben, Piccadilly, neon, ads, shops and more. It is just too large and makes the characters seem lost and more traditionally animated. This scene is reminiscent of the same company's "Shark Tales"; we watch Will Smith's character swim into an underwater version of Times Square.

Honestly, when I saw the trailers for "Flushed" I thought Roddy was voiced by Ralph Fiennes. After his appearance in "Curse of the Were-Rabbit", it fit. So I was shocked to learn the voice was Hugh Jackman. He does a good job of playing a rich, upper-class rat, used to a life of privilege in the Royal Borough of Kensington. Kate Winslet does a good job as Rita, the skipper of her own boat, with a large family to look after, providing for her disabled dad (David Suchet) and mum (Kathy Burke) and their ever increasing brood. But their performances are just a little too ordinary. They don't add another dimension to these characters.

The real voice talent lies in the supporting cast of characters. Sir Ian McKellan seems to have a great time playing a larger than life Toad bent of controlling his little universe. He has some funny moments throughout the film; for instance when he shows off his prized collection of ceramic representations of the Royal Family, he smiles broadly like a child showing his report card, eager for a nod of approval. He is all bombast and ego as he tries to continue with his evil plan, making him a funny take off of many of the James Bond villains.

Jean Reno is also amusing as Le Frog, the leader of a band of French frogs who wear leather jackets and do the bidding of their cousin, the Toad. At one point, he yells for his followers to respond and they shout "We surrender." Later, he is perturbed to have his coffee interrupted and throws a coin on his Parisian caf table before hopping off.

Bill Nighy is also very good as Whitey, the brain damaged henchman of the Toad. He states "I used to be a laboratory rat. Dealt with a lot of shampoo and now I'm white." Throughout, he adds a certain goofy charm to the role.

The film contains a couple of ongoing funny jokes. When Roddy first arrives in the sewers, he encounters a large group of slugs, who are as terrified of the rat as the rat is of them. They scream a high pitched squeal and attempt to run away, but their progress is slow. Throughout the film, they return and provide a sort of Greek chorus, singing songs from the 50s and 60s, fitting for that particular moment in the film.

Perhaps the funniest ongoing joke is the Mime Frog. The band of French motorcycle gang frogs have a mime who accompanies them everywhere. When they first appear, they stop for a moment, so he can do a little routine. Later, when they are confronting Rita and Roddy, Le Frog brings out a cell phone with a camera and the Mime places it in front of his face. While the Toad speaks to them from afar, the Mime acts out the Toad's gestures, pace, inflections and more. A couple of times the Toad gets exasperated with the Mime, yelling at him to do something. It is an original and funny sequence.

The character transformations for Roddy and Rita happen way too fast. One moment, they are fighting each other, pairing up simply because they have to. Then they are suddenly longing for each other's company and they want to spend the rest of their lives together. This is not a subtle change and brings to mind the type of character development one would find in an animated series on television. Why couldn't they find a few more moments, another story development to make this more believable? The problem is the kids won't even notice this type of thing. It is the adult chauffeur's who will and keeps the film from joining the hallowed ranks of animated classics.

During the screening, I noticed one father snoring loudly throughout the entire film. Clearly, his interest was not held. And I can't believe he was the only one.

"Flushed Away" is cute, bright, and full of energy but has story problems and the larger canvas robs the animation of any intimacy. Why try to recreate the look of Claymation in CGI if you are going to try to make the landscape huge? Claymation begs for intimacy. "Flushed Away" is a film sure to keep the kids happy and adults will have a few laughs. It is a good animated effort, not as good as some I have seen this year ("Cars", "Monster House", Open Season", "Over the Hedge") and far better than others ("Ant Bully").

Go to a bargain matinee.

I'm also glad she made friends with the princess. I think Emily's modern ideas may get her in trouble. I also enjoyed the ending.```

            ```sample_0: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: What worked in one generation might not work for another generation. The way things are communicated are not the same ten years ago. Cultural trends come and go along with hairstyles.

Some people say the church falls into that category as well. Think about it. What worked in the 1950's does not work in the 21st century. Gary L McIntosh in his book, Growing God's Church, talks about research that has been done over the last ten years on how people are coming to faith. McIntosh expresses that some churches have become missional with evangelism as a primary task. To be honest, I have never known a missional church that wasn't evangelistic but he does make a good point. Evangelism needs to be one of the top priorities of the church.

The gospel message brings us to believe in Christ or reject him, McIntosh expresses,and there no middle ground, which is true. In some churches we have messages where you can come to Christ without following him. If you read the Bible, you know believing in Christ means to follow Christ.

McIntosh continues to talk more on the research on how people came to faith in Christ, what led them to Christ, and what keeps them in the church. He even addresses the pastor's role in evangelism, which a pastor does have a role in reaching people for Christ but so does the entire church. He concludes the book on what steps a church need to take to be effective evangelists which some of them almost sound seeker-friendly but I know he is trying not to express that.

In short, Growing God's Church is a helpful book for those who want to see the church reaching the lost. I don't think it will make the top 10 church growth method books, but it is a decent book to read.

Actually the competitor seeds germinated faster and more of them.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: I liked Tate and Murphy a whole lot more than Lash and Angel from bk 1. Tate was a tough, mouthy, ballsy b! tch and I definitely prefer that type of woman to the meek, completely submissive Angel. Murphy was the right amount of alpha and I love that he loved and appreciated all of Tate's qualities.
I liked that Tate was stubborn and didn't just accept Murphy back into her life too quickly. He hurt her and I do think his excuses were kinda lame. He did volunteer to be a spy knowing they would be separated, knowing she would think he betrayed them. Why not let someone else do it? Now Murphy is back years later to claim Tate and expects her to just accept him without explanation, not trying to earn her trust back in any way? He needed to work a little harder, and grovel!
When Tiny and Eva get their book, I hope she gives him crap, makes him suffer awhile!
Nash disgusts me, sleeping with one sister, treating her like garbage while having feelings for the other, holding her in high regard...what a nasty pig! Unfortunately, after reading reviews for the other books in the series, this appears to be a reaccouring theme for these men, loving/having feelings for one woman but sleeping with other women, some even outright cheating. I'm tired of reading about guys like this, it's not romantic and I just don't trust them to be faithful in the future. I guess that I need to stick to books with men I don't wanna do bodily harm to.```

I enjoyed Wendy and Drew's relationship.  Their chemistry was on fire.  You could tell right from the beginning they were meant for each other.  Drew pined for her for 5 years.  There was no way he could be away from her after being with her and the way they fit so perfectly together.  As the weeks went by, their feelings were growing stronger and stronger.  By the last few days together, I couldn't read the words that were on the page without crying.  It was so powerful.  The emotions that were swirling around.  It was a beautiful story and I plan on reading more of Jami's work.```

One of the issues was mayo, because I need it to make homemade ranch (vegan or not!). So when I saw this at my local Meijer, it caught my attention. After reading the ingredients, I decided to give it a go! We were not disappointed AT ALL! Literally the only difference between this and regular mayo is that this one is tangier, giving it just a little extra kick. My boyfriend, who was neutral on mayo, loves it! He wanted to throw out the old mayo so we could exclusively eat this one. I've never seen him so excited for mayo! It's great for my new vegan ranch recipe, and tastes like normal mayo on a sandwich or in tartar sauce; if you mix it, you can't tell it's tangier than regular. I'm so glad I found it! However, it is much cheaper in stores than online (around $5-6).

{
  "sample_0": 5,
  "sample_1": 4
}
```

Based on the content of the reviews, here are the predicted scores:

- `sample_0`: 5 - The reviewer is very positive about the product, highlighting its benefits for their vegan and dairy-free lifestyle. They mention that the vegan mayo is practically indistinguishable from regular mayo, except for being tangier. The reviewer's enthusiasm, satisfaction with the product's taste, and how it meets their needs suggest a high rating.

- `sample_1`: 4 - The reviewer provides a positive assessment of a book's writing, character engagement, and the multiple conspiracies and plots within the story. While the reviewer acknowledges the engaging nature of the story and its well-handled elements, they also express some reservations due to personal preferences for fiction that is more removed from possible reality. Despite this, the overall impression of the book seems favorable.

===============================================

This is Arthur Clarke's fifth short story collection, as well as one of the strangest and most powerful ones. Unlike the four previous volumes, published between 1953 and 1958, Tales of Ten Worlds consists - with one exception - only of pieces written no more than a few years earlier, namely when Clarke was in his forties and at the very beginning of his long prime. Of courses the collection is uneven, but any faults or limitations it might have are completely obscured by its considerable merits. The latter, in a nutshell, can be stated as follows: this is probably Arthur Clarke's most varied and richest collection; none of the pieces is dull or valueless; many of them are in fact genuine masterpieces. Where to start?

Well, let me start with my absolute personal favourite: ''Death and the Senator''. Now, quite simply, this is one of the most perfect stories I have ever read: sounds trite but it happens to be true. Even on the most mundane level, the story is impeccable in terms of fine structure, narrative subtlety and sharp dialogue. The plot is perfectly conceived and executed with rare skill. Ironically enough, this is one of the stories that were ''spoiled'' for me by Arthur himself, for in one of his non-fiction works he gives away the plot completely. If anything, this only proves that when we're dealing with great literature such things like ''spoilers'' simply do not exist. It will be hardly difficult for anybody to guess the ending from the very title and, perhaps, the opening paragraph.

What makes ''Death and the Senator'' a fabulously brilliant piece of writing is the character of Martin Steelman, drawn with such depth and shattering vividness that you find but seldom in a short story, and of course numerous hard questions about the meaning of life he comes to reflect upon just a little too late. All other characters are secondary, but none is any less alive or compelling for that. All those people who still rant about Clarke's ''flat characters'' should read this story very carefully indeed. To cut the long story short, ''Death and the Senator'' alone is enough to give this book five full stars. Not often do I find a piece of short-fiction so heart-rending and affecting and at the same time uplifting and even amusing. Here is an example that made me laugh:

'''What's that?, cried Joey.
'It's an elephant, stupid,' answered Susan with all the crushing superiority of her seven years.''

And here is one that made me very sad:

''It was a sad reflection on Martin Steelman, if so commonplace a fact as showing an interest in his own grandchildren could cause curiosity.''

But there is so much more in this book, and the variety is so overwhelming, that I again don't know how to continue. True, these stories may not bring you to ''ten worlds'', but you can personally visit at least eight: Earth, Moon, Venus, Mars, Saturn, a glorious comet, a hot asteroid and the open space.

There are few other stories, in addition to ''Death and the Senator'', in which science takes only a minor part, being used only as a supplement to plots concerned with social, political and personal issues that every great fiction is bound to deal with. Two immediate favourites are ''I Remember Babylon'' and ''Hate'', both of them nearly perfectly written stories with lots of food for reflection.

''I Remember Babylon'' is a very weird story indeed. Here Clarke did beat Maugham himself for a piece of fiction most firmly rooted in reality. Not only does he use his own name several times, but he describes a glittering diplomatic party in Sri Lanka which was surely drawn from life; there is even one compelling reference to Maugham himself, as Arthur was ''surveying the scene in my detached or Somerset Maugham manner''. It is not at all easy to realise where the non-fiction ends and where the fiction starts. Yet the story smoothly turns into a marvellous dystopian vision of worldwide TV propaganda beyond censorship, in which Clarke's own, and pioneering, ideas about communication satellites play a prominent role. Whether the world in general and the States in particular have fallen, are falling or will fall down as Babylon did is a matter of fascinating speculation, but Clarke was probably not so wide of the mark when he wryly remarked in the notes to his Collected Stories that virtually everything in this story has come true. The only difference, of course, is that TV has been considerably helped by the World Wide Wait (sorry, Web, as Arthur once joked) in the process of global mind corruption. Nobody disputes the great benefits, or even some noble intentions that may have been there in the beginning, but this is a very scanty compensation for brainwashing on a vast scale.

''Hate'' reflects another of Clarke's passions: diving and ocean exploration (more like exploitation in this case). The story takes place entirely in the ocean and on the board of a small boat, yet it is one of the most overtly political works in Arthur's oeuvre - who never shied away from dealing with politics in his fiction anyway, as obvious from ''I Remember Babylon'' and its ''minor political earthquakes''. The protagonist in ''Hate'' is a Hungarian who passionately hates the Russians, clearly a reference to the disturbing events from 1956, and what this fellow does when confronted with a Russian astronaut trapped, but still alive, at the bottom of the ocean you can imagine. Though predictable, the story has an excellent twist in the end which makes one contemplate with horror the prospect of being at Tibor's place. In addition to devastatingly perceptive description of love's antithesis, another strength of ''Hate'' lies in the vividly recreated life of the pearl hunters, where every mistake under water may well be your last, and particularly in the masterful description of the horrifying obsession that hate may easily turn to. Disturbing, provocative and not easily forgotten story that will bear a good deal of re-reading.

(By the way, an interesting leitmotif in this collection is one of the most unfortunately natural states of the human beings: panic. In "Hate" you get an underwater example, and in "Summertime on Icarus" and "Who's There?" you get equally vivid examples in a space ship and in the open space, respectively.)

Right on the other side of science fiction are stories like ''Summertime on Icarus'' and ''Before Eden'' which can be described, rather ineptly, as "hard science fiction", or ''gimmick stories'' as Arthur would snap, and which in lesser hands would be a tedious stuff to read. Not so here. ''Summertime on Icarus'' is perhaps the most suspenseful story in the volume, taking place, of all places indeed, on a small asteroid passing extremely close to the Sun. There Colin Sherrard crashed his ship and was about to be roasted alive by a merciless sunlight which has nothing to do with its feeble cousin that reaches the Earth. The story really should have been titled ''Dawn on Icarus'', but it is a superb piece of dramatic characterisation none the less for that. Colin's panic, accompanied with harrowing screaming, is reminiscent of ''Who's There?'' and ''Out of the Cradle, Endlessly Orbiting . . . '', two other tales of similar type but on a slighter and more humorous scale. As for ''Before Eden'', it transports us to the South Pole - of Venus, where the temperature is ''only a hundred degrees hotter than Death Valley in midsummer.'' Apart from the moral that we, humans, are very careless when we are handling any other kinds of life but our own, the story has a number of ravishing descriptions of the Venusian landscape. Some of these are as haunting and visionary as anything on paper:

''Jerry was still mulling this over when they came upon the lake. Even that first glimpse, it made him think not of the life they were seeking, but of death. Like a black mirror, it lay amid a fold in the hills; its far edge was hidden in the eternal mist, and ghostly columns of vapour swirled and danced upon its surface. All it needed, Jerry told himself, was Charron's ferry waiting to take them to the other side - or the Swan of Tuonela swimming majestically back and forth as it guarded the entrance to the Underworld...''

(Here is another piece of evidence that Arthur did love Sibelius - the composer I mean, not the computer program. While writing the above he must have been hearing in his head the beautiful tone pone The Swan of Tuonela, with that wistful English horn that's just about to break your heart...)

Stories like ''Saturn Rising'' and ''Dog Star'' occupy the no-man's-land between pure science fiction and normal (scienceless?) fiction. Both combine adroitly poignant and amusing moments. ''Saturn Rising'' looks forward into the distant future when we shall, perhaps, have luxurious hotels on Saturn's satellites, with Observation Lounges from which to contemplate the rising of Saturn. That must be a sight all right, but the story goes much deeper than that, exploring our eternal struggle between success and happiness. ''Dog Star'' is the story you should not read in case you are a dog lover - or get yourself some tissues for it is likely to make you cry; I can't say that I am a dog lover myself, but it certainly made me. The protagonist of the story is one of those unfortunate creatures who communicates much better with animals than with human beings - a type most easy to identify with, I'm afraid - but has to choose between his job and his dog. As it turned out, the choice was harder for Laika than he expected. The ending could hardly have been more heartbreaking. After dismissing, gently but firmly, any mystery about the psychic relationship between him and his dog, the narrator finishes thus:

Of that I am sure, if I am sure of anything. Yet sometimes I wake now, in the silence of the Moon, and wish that the dream could have lasted a few seconds longer - so that I could have looked just once into those luminous brown eyes, brimming with an unselfish, undemanding love I have found nowhere else on this or any other world.

Last but not least, to dispel the gloom a little bit, there is the group of deliberately - please note that word: deliberately - flippant stories, usually shorter and consistently tongue-in-cheek, and altogether a great fun to read. ''Let There Be Light'' was a most pleasant surprise because of the unexpected appearance of Harry Purvis, the learned crackpot who used to be the center of entertainment in the legendary (but only semi-fictitious) pub ''White Hart''. Apparently this story - a delightful variation of the perfect crime theme - came a little too late to be included in Tales from the White Hart (1958). "Trouble with Time" is another mini crime thriller, set on Mars and concerned with shady deals with antiques, and ''An Ape About the House'' is a vastly amusing tale about a gene-modified Pan sapiens, the future equivalent of housemaid, that suddenly reveals a considerable talent for painting. But my greatest favourite in this category definitely is ''A Slight Case of Sunstroke''.

Truth to tell, while reading ''A Slight Case of Sunstroke'' I nearly died - of laughter. When Clarke feels like it, he really can be dangerously hilarious. The strange thing is that the story mostly deals, of all things, with South American football passions. To call the piece satire would probably be an overstatement, yet the ''pretty open game'' with no more than three fights and the referee with ''distinctly laboured'' movements because of the bulletproof vest he is wearing are not so far removed from reality as they should be on any civilized planet. However, the story does have a fine scientific premise of which a stunning use is made towards the end. All I can say about it is that the title is a monumental understatement. In between Clarke pokes lots of fun at the South American politics, diplomacy and customs, one more corrupt than the other (including the narrator), reaching an absolutely stunning climax when he comes to the football mores in the hypothetical countries Perivia and Panagura. So be careful with this short story. It causes tremendous convulsions which do take some time to die out.

The rather prosaically titled ''The Road to the Sea'' is the maverick here. It is the only short story written considerably earlier than the rest and, running to more than fifty pages (one fourth of the whole book!), it is rather like a novella - ''horrid word'' as Arthur once snapped. Before going into detail, having a mild passion for gorgeous covers, I want to point out that this golden and terrific, though stylised, Sphinx that adorns the Pan edition refers exactly to the last piece in the collection. Why it had to wait more than ten years to be collected in book form is beyond me. For I stand corrected: this is the supreme masterpiece here, and for it alone five full stars are not enough. It is so rich in content that I am a little surprised that Arthur didn't regard it as a ''compressed novel'', badly in need of decompression, as did he with ''The Songs of Distant Earth'', ''The Deep Range'', ''Against the Fall of the Night'' (which became ''The City and the Stars'') and ''The Hammer of God'', to name but a few.

''The Road to the Sea'' is one of those fabulous pieces of fiction which tax my imagination to the utmost. Arthur does that kind of fiction disturbingly well. Here he sends you no fewer than five thousand (!) years ahead, in a time when mankind has conquered the stars and learnt many, though not all, of its numerous secrets. On mother Earth only a small fraction has remained, scattered in small villages after the mighty cities had been abandoned, reverting to ancient rituals and unabashedly hedonistic lifestyle - or to stupendous mental and physical sloth. These are ideas Arthur has explored many times in his speculative non-fiction: if the former still lies into the far future, the latter is already knocking on the door.

As has often been noted by the author, there is nothing wrong with uninhibited pleasure as long as it is not the only way. Following the coming of age and the romantic inspirations of Brant, necessarily in a condensed form, raises yet again the shattering dilemma of achievements versus reveries. How should we live our lives: lost in futile but intoxicating day-dreaming or dissipating all our energies in the exploration of the unknown. Sounds commonplace but the truth, as almost always, is somewhere in the middle. Exactly where nobody really knows, but works like ''The Road to the Sea'' might just give you a solid base for reflection on this conundrum. There's no better way to finish, I think, than quoting few not altogether forgettable lines of wisdom from this literary tour de force:

''The person one loves never really exists, but is a projection focused through the lens of the mind onto whatever screen it fits with least distortion.''

''No one had ever told her, and she had not yet discovered, that when one has to ask 'Am I really in love?', the answer is always 'No'.''

A) Oh so relatable. I loved reading about Kari's real life experiences. I felt like she could've been writing about me, the crush-crazy, teeny-bopper that I was anyway. I laughed out loud at her story about not wearing glasses in math class because she didn't want the boy she liked to think she was a nerd. That was so me! I feel like Kari's stories are perfect for both mothers and daughters. Moms, you all remember what the teen years were like. Daughters, trust me, this is a fun read. Not preachy or boring. Kari knows where you've been and relates like a girlfriend.

B) The quizzes and discussion questions. The little quizzes throughout the book reminded me of the quizzes I always liked to read in teen magazines when I was younger. I thought they were the perfect addition to a book for teen girls. The discussion questions at the end of each chapter are straightforward and real. Kari knows exactly what to ask and provides questions you really have to think about.

C) The design. The totally cute design really hooked me before I even knew what this book was about. I loved the colors and flowers. I also like that this book is thin, so it's not intimidating for girls who may not be readers. 10 Ultimate Truths Girls Should Know is the perfect gift book. I highly recommend it for girls ages 12-16.

Disclosure:

I received a copy of 10 Ultimate Truths Girls Should Know from Tommy Nelson Mommy. All views and opinions are solely and completely my own. I was not asked to write a positive review. I received no compensation other than a print copy of the book featured in this post, which is mine to keep or gift as I so choose.

The characters, such as Selena and Nick, are believable and there is no sugar coating on their relationship - Nick must get counselling or no longer sleep with Selena. There is a humorous aside with their boss, Harker, pampering the cat, even talking to it. All of the action as they follow Nostradamus' quatrains involve shooting and people being killed. For a full-on action story, this one is it. So where is the Ark?
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: J.R.R. Tolkien's The Two Towers continues the delightful adventures of the now-divided Fellowship.  The story moves at a faster clip than the first book with action bouncing through the story of Pippin, Merry, Legolas, Gimli and Aragorn and a terrific sense of suspense crawling and creeping through the story of Frodo and Sam.  The emotional resonances among the characters are also much deeper in this volume, particularly in such aspects as the relationship between Sam and Frodo.  The two main reasons, though, for this readers' joy are the Ents and Gollum.  The ents are the most dazzling creation by the author of Middle Earth and Treebeard should live as one of the most memorable fantasy figures of all time.  And as for Gollum, I was pleased to discover how much I liked his prescence.  I found him a little trying in The Hobbit but here he works so very well.  A rollicking adventure-horror-fantasy.```

The a capella voices of the nuns on this album make for a beautiful background soundtrack, but I prefer them as the music that I listen to when I pray or when I am relaxing in the evening and reading. The songs are a combination of Latin music and classical English-lyric songs, but all of them are beautiful.  The music is soothing and enjoyable; I love that I can't sing along and can truly let my thoughts go when listening to this.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Light, wholesome,  and entertaining. The characters are likeable-  Penny's spunky while Harrison's sweet and such a gentleman. Perfect for an afternoon read.```

            ```sample_0: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Portable document scanners are supposed to be handy. Their real competition is against scanning apps like Smile Software's PDFpen Scan +, my current favorite scanning app which promises to "turn your iPad into a flatbed scanner."  That is an overstatement by the app-maker because what it really does is apply optical character recognition to pdfs created from the camera of iPad or iPhone. However for may situations that is enough and the need for a foot long one pound scanner is not clear.

The age of iPad has many lawyers shucking their trial bags and hard copy files in favor of showing up at deposition or for a hearing with just an iPad. Taking along an additional piece of equipment to, say copy exhibits offered by an opposing party, almost always requires some sort of bag to lug things in. This scanner weighs as much as my iPad Air, so right off the bat, it doubles the mass required to go to deposition. Add a small nylon laptop case and that's even more to carry.

As to the scanner itself, it isn't really a substitute for the much heavier but much more feature laden scanners like the six pound&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Fujitsu-ScanSnap-iX500-Scanner-for-PC-and-Mac-PA03656-B005/dp/B00ATZ9QMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500 Scanner for PC and Mac (PA03656-B005)</a>&nbsp;Scanner. That scanner, which has an automatic document feeder, duplex scanner (two sides of a document copied at once), and simply astonishing speed. It also has an app allowing the scanner to operate from an iPad app and save directly to iPad. Were I to know ahead of time that I would need to copy hundreds of pages of exhibits, I would not hesitate to bring the larger scanner particularly if I knew I could get it and iPad on the same wireless network.

As to the scanner itself. the scanned images are excellent, and it has a reasonable rated speed of 8 ppm for black and white and color  images. However it does not duplex and the documents have to be hand fed. You cannot use it like a flatbed scanner for obvious reasons.  The resulting pdfs still need to be run through an OCR app, something the PDFpen Scan + can do. It supports wireless transfer via a free app  but I gave up on that, preferring to scan to the 4GB SD card that come with the scanner. The interface itself is poor.

So at the end of the day, this is a nice scanner but it is a product whose inherent limitations should cause you to consider carefully how much actual use it will receive.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Much like the author, I was once overweight (though, not a drinker nor smoker). I lead a very sedentary lifestyle. My ideal dinner was a whole frozen pizza, quart of Nesquik chocolate milk, and Twinkies for dessert. I hated the guy staring back at me in the mirror, and every weekend I made the promise that I would start dieting the following Monday. Guess how well that went ... .

To make a long story short, 75 lbs. lighter, and a few years wiser, I just ran my first half marathon this year, finishing in 1:56:12. Running has given me an amazing new appreciation for life, and I cannot imagine my life without it. Thus, hearing John "The Penguin" Bingham discuss his struggles with getting off the couch and taking his first steps on the pavement, made me smile.

The Accidental Athlete is a very short, quick, easy read (would have been a great on-going magazine article) that many will find inspiring. John humorously chronicles how he went from being on the fast track to an early grave, to trying to settle on a sport in which he could do well, to completing dozens of marathons and other races across the country, painfully detailing every struggle with which most runners will identify. While John never became a supreme runner (instead enjoying being in the back of the pack), his drive to better himself has made him a champion.

For the athlete -- or wannabe athlete -- in all of us, do yourself a favor and give this one a read.```

            ```sample_0: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: This book was just everything I hoped and prayed and wanted and needed it to be, and then it was even better than that. God, it was just so beautiful in both spirit and prose. I seriously want every person I know to read these two books. It's hard for me to explain what makes this series so wonderful to me and the only thing I can come up with is these books have the most beautiful SOUL. The story is honest, believable, fluid. The ups and downs are heart affirming and heart wrenching and the characters are real, beautiful, flawed and perfect all at the same time.

Rhyson is one of my favorite male characters of all time. He is gorgeous both inside and out, talented, smart, funny and completely head over heals for Kia. He is also flawed, damaged and desperate to hold on to the love of his life. Watching him come to terms with his actions and their consequences and seeing him work for forgiveness and redemption is simply a breathtaking journey. Kia is an amazing female lead. Her strength and determination is inspiring, her heartbreak and insecurities are humanizing and her love for Rhys is a thing of beauty, but watching her figure out how to not lose herself in the Rhyson's shadow is what makes her character so much more captivating than I'm used to reading. These two characters are so multi-faceted, so complete, so extraordinary and yet so completely down to earth, that you can't help but feel every emotion they feel.

Kennedy Ryan is simply an amazing writer. She understand intrinsically how people interact, love, fight, play and connect. Every emotion, every reaction and every consequence was real and believable. There were times I wanted to scream at these characters, times I wanted to comfort them, times my heart broke for them and times I rejoiced for them. Every emotion was present and accounted for and Kennedy pulled them out of me even when I didn't want her to. I always feel some kind of emotion when I finish a series, sometimes happiness, sometimes sorrow because it's over, sometimes frustration because I did like the way something was handled. When I finished this series I felt like rejoicing, like my heart was full, sated, and joyous right down to my soul.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: I have to agree with other reviewers, the leveling part is more in the way than being useful.  When the container is full it is pretty much useless.  I find this container to be overprized for what it is, there are simpler, better options out there that cost less.```

This recording was made by one of the great violinists of his generation. Historically this recording is both a classic and out of fashion.  Puritans have their own heroes. For me this is  most beautiful art by aver fine artist. There is music here for anyone who wants to hear it. The vibrato seems restrained to me. And I only regret the balance between the duet favoured violin. This is one of the four of five classic recordings.
There are fine artists who have made more recent musically " correct" readings, technically brilliant.  But,  to my  ear, mostly Academic.```

            ```sample_0: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Bought this to put on my dog's Molly Mutt duvet/bed.  She doesn't really like it.  She still prefers her bed pillow.  This does come in handy to keep her from leaning on the hard wall, but takes up too much of the bed area.  I also wish it could be made to go the long way, not the short way.  It might be more useful for us.  It washes/dries well, but has faded some.  The construction is sturdy and so far, the zipper has held up well.  Don't know if I would buy this again.  UPDATE:  Well, it's been over a year and a half now and I've purchased three more of these pillow packs.  They aren't perfect; but, I guess they do come in handy.  They have held up well (except for the fading) and my new dog seems to like these more than my old dog.  Glad the price came down on these too.  Will buy again someday.
sample_1: What is the score of the following review on a scale of 1 to 5? just answer with 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 without further explanation. review: Works.  Holds the hole open, and we can fit the cleaning nozzle down the hole.  We also use it over the winter to keep the seal from sitting on the sliding closure.  When it is closed all winter, we almost can't get it to open in the spring.```
