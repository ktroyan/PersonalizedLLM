# customizedLLM
A repository part of a "Customized/Personalized LLMs" project.

An initial step is to collect a considerable amount of appropriate data: user profiles (UPs) and associated natural language text. We principally consider pairs such as (UP, text) or (UP, QA). Further, we process those data in order to create meaningful and clean datasets that can then be used as part of the training process of personalized/customized LLMs such as ChatGPT.
