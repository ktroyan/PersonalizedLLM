What can I say about our dinner experience. My wife and I were celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary and I wanted it to be special. From the moment we walked in, we were greeted with a very friendly and professional staff. Our table was very convenient and were served by extremely nice wait staff. The wine was terrific, the food (salmon for my wife and a steak for myself) was exceptional, and the timing couldn’t have been better. In celebration of our anniversary, the waiter brought out a plate of complimentary dessert with “Happy Anniversary” written on the perimeter. Everything was delicious and we were fortunate enough to meet the owner’s son who was very nice welcoming us to the restaurant and congratulating us on our anniversary. I conveyed our pleasure with our visit and hope to visit again. He even assisted us in hailing a cab for our trip downtown in time for our theater stay. Definitely a great place for dinner.

We have had dinner tonight at this amazing steak house, and I cannot wait to wright a review.  At fisrt, the place sends a message of being vibrant and cosy, with musiciens playing soft jazz and blues. As our experience started, service was precise and extremely attentive; the waiter was caring without excess but in a very simple and polite manner. Nothing different to expect from a restaurant one could say, however, experiences in NYC have not always showed the same. The quality of our dinner has been outstanding: we shared a starter - a crab cake- was extremely fresh and generous. The entree - a porterhouse for two- was perfectly served, at the right temperature, which is not easy when requesting beef to be bleu! Throughout our dinner, the presence and the eye of the owner - Mr Bruno Selimaj - never stopped being there, himself taking personal care of all guests well-being.  This is our seventh trip to NYC, without having being able to travel here in the past two years because of COVID, but Club A is an address we will keep in our minds for our next visit: a restaurant you must experience!

The best steak I have ever eaten, period! The filet is 10 oz and was so tender and flavorful that I was in steak heaven. The Club A is a dining experience that you have to try if you are in the mood for a steak. The staff will treat you like family and Bruno the owner will come by your table to chat and check to make sure everything is to your liking. This is the second time I have eaten there and both times did not disappoint. I highly recommend this steak house as you will truly have a magical experience.

Nice and quiet for the first half hour until the restaurant got more crowded. Host did a great job spacing customers apart as much as possible until it got busier. Service was fantastic and very attentive without hovering. Each course was served promptly but did not feel rushed. Burrata cheese with cherry tomato and arugula appetizer was the freshest cheese I've had a restaurant - seasoned perfectly with lovely presentation. I had the squid ink spaghetti with scampi langoustine and squash blossoms - the pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly with a velvety smooth and rich sauce. Definitely one of the best pasta dishes I've had! Dessert was very good - cannoli had perfectly crisp and flavorful shells with a delectable filling. The custard in the tiramisu and creme brulee was smooth, rich, and flavorful. I would highly recommend this restaurant - try to come early because it is cramped and when it fills up, you have no elbow room. Cost is a bit pricey, but not bad for quality of food and service and location!!

Can’t help feeling a bit disappointed with our experience to be perfectly honest because it really didn’t live up to the reviews and I think maybe we were really unlucky.  We had made a reservation and when we turned up at the restaurant there was a couple just in front of us who had arrived without a reservation. Without asking us first, the guy on the door showed them straight to a table and when he then came back to welcome us, we then had to wait for about 10 minutes while he found a table (clearly he hadn’t checked the reservations before seating the other couple and/or had given our table away).  No apology, pretty inattentive service - having experienced amazing customer service in NYC, this guy definitely wasn’t someone I’d have put in charge of arrivals!  When we were seated, there was barely any room at the tiny tables. The restaurant was very busy so consequently it was incredibly noisy and while I know this contributes to atmosphere, it was impossible to have a quiet conversation (not least because the other tables were so so close!).  Food was good, but honestly I wasn’t blown away - I’ve definitely had better Italian food elsewhere in NYC and in Glasgow and London.  We had the duetto bruschetta to start with burrata, porcini and truffle and guacamole and lobster. It was nice, although the truffle was overpowering and I personally am not particularly convinced by the pairing of guacamole and lobster.  Then we had the Bucantini cacio e pepe with truffle and a special ravioli dish with seafood sauce and mussels.  Cacio e Pepe is my all time favourite Italian dish. I’m afraid I wasn’t blown away by this one. The pasta was a little more than al dente and the truffle sauce overpowered the simple cacio e pepe sauce too much.  The ravioli was filled with spinach and ricotta accompanying a very rich seafood sauce, it was nice but again a little heavy.  We had a very nice bottle of Primitivo, that was probably the highlight.  Generally the service wasn’t great - probably because it was so busy, but still. Twice in the hour we were there birthdays were announced with music so loud it could burst your ear drums - a tradition I don’t mind so much because it’s nice to make a fuss of someone on their bday but the music went on for so long, long after people had lost interest!  I don’t like writing negative reviews because it is so difficult running and maintaining restaurants profitably and so all the positives should be celebrated. But this place is so highly rated I just wanted to provide some balance for travellers particularly because this wasn’t the outstanding quiet dinner I was expecting.

"I was asked to out to dine at this restaurant with 6 Italian's (4 of them from New York) so I thought that it was always going to be a fabulous meal and a good evening and it totally lived up to those expectations. This restaurant, like the name suggests, is a small kitchen, (with the 4 chef's busy within, which you can see clearly from the dining area). Whilst small they cram in a lot of guests, which ordinarily if in any other restaurant you would probably think (""This is too cramped"") BUT at this restaurant it totally works and just adds to the amazing Italian party atmosphere that this place has, it really was fabulous and fun. The food was some of the best Italian I have ever eaten... The meatballs with mushroom and truffle to start was just divine and the ricotta ravioli with mushroom and pieces of sausage was also a dish that I didn't want to end. Prices are not too bad either with a feast of a dinner with a bottle of wine costing US$420 for 7 people. I finished sharing a traditional Sicilian dessert called a 'Cassata' with my friend (who is of Sicilian origins) and it was absolutely delicious... The perfect end to a perfect Italian evening in downtown Manhattan. I highly recommend this gem of a restaurant."

Cacio Pepe is a traditional Appulian dish done perfectly. Pachheri Seafood excellent. Patate Limoni and Verdure Grigliate great accompaniments. It is very noisy, but mostly from people talking and having a good time. Spontaneous dancing broke during our meal - just like dining in a local resto in southern Italy.

We first went to their restaurant on Spring Street, which is very small & extremely noisy, so noisy we left and went around the corner to their, mainly, fish restaurant. I had the spagetti Nero with Langoustines and zucchini flowers. The sauce was lacking in flavour and was very peppery. They must have run out of zucchini flowers (already at 1:30pm) because there were none. My wife had the wild boar meatballs with porcini mushrooms and truffles. Both meals were okay, but not top notch Italian/Sicilian. They have very few Sicilian wines, and a lot of Tuscan / Piedmontese, which is probably understandable in the US. Sicily does have a lot of great wine producers so perhaps they aren't available here. They did have one Planeta rose, which is good, but for a popular choice Plumbago would be good. Work needs to be done in the kitchen & on the wine list, then perhaps they will live up to the name they created.

We ordered the chateaubriand medium rare, allowing that the ends would be closer to medium. It came out a little under where we would have liked it, but it was acceptable and very, very good. The veggies served with it were also nice, but for some reason the bone marrow didn’t hit the spot(normally I love it).  Now to the elephant in the room … THE WINE LIST ! I mean ?!$&@%*^}{!!!  I think there was less than 5% under $100. And some of those $100 bottles were $20 retail and who knows what the restaurant pays. I know we have inflation, but the wine list has ENORMOUS 4-5x markups (or more).  Food 9/10 Service 8/10 (slow start)

Festively decked out for the Christmas holidays, Boucherie was unbelievably busy on this Friday afternoon.  In order to dine in a New York City restaurant (12/21), one must show proof of a covid vaccination and we were lucky to also have a reservation for lunch, as the place became crowded quickly. There are 3 levels - the bottom level is the busiest since it is near the bar and kitchen. The 2nd level is smaller and intimate and the top level is reserved for larger parties.  We sat on the 2nd level and it was easy to have a conversation amid the hubub of the other patrons. Our waiter was very attentive and able to answer any & all questions. There was a separate waiter who took care of our water and wine needs.  My friend and I took advantage of the Prix Fixe menu by ordering the french onion soup, mussels, ravioli with mushrooms and chicken paillard. The only dish that was not enjoyable was the chicken - it was very dry and lacked taste. The onion soup was to die for, as were the mussels and the ravioli melted in my mouth.  We also had French white wine and dessert. The ambiance was festive and very Parisian. Will definitely return.

Their dark chocolate panna cotta with fresh berries was heavenly. Service was friendly and efficient."

It was packed at lunchtime and is clearly popular with workers and tourists alike. We browsed the store whilst we waited for our table. Couldn't wait to order the coconut shrimp appetizer, which we'd seen but not tried before. We also ordered the fish tacos again. Service was very good, both at reception and at the table. Coconut shrimp was amazing - no wonder it's the signature dish. The fish in the tacos was very good, but sadly let down by the dressing, which was so wet it made the taco disintegrate very quickly. The plantain side, served with the dish, is delicious. Overall a very good meal and I would happily dine here again - with a reservation next time!

Impeccable, attentive service from the waitstaff who frequently asking if we needed anything and refilled our water glasses as we needed it. Very nice plump coconut shrimps for appetizer and very much enjoyed the halibut special with quinoa and one of the margarita special drinks while my wife enjoyed a well prepared filet with garlic potatoes and greens. The warm bread with a cinamon and ginger butter spread was a nice touch. Offered a nice selection of delicious looking desserts but at that point were too full to partake. A gifted singer entertained us with music selection from the 60's through 80's. Nice evening spent after a long day hiking around the city. After leaving the restaurant, bought a few items from the retail clothing store located downstairs.

Service can be erratic. On this visit the front of the restaurant was sectioned off for a private holiday party. Needless to say they were enjoying their cocktails and were very loud. This impacted our leisurely dining experience in a negative way. I believe when restaurants decide to take large parties that will impact the ""regular"" diner, they should accommodate the other patrons in some way... a drink, dessert, something to acknowledge the inconvenience... not just think it's ok.  Our coconut shrimp, crab cakes, salads, and the taco soup were very good. Chicken and Tuna entrees were enjoyed by all. The cold mashed potatoes served with the chicken were happily replaced.  Wines and drinks were very good.  Not our best meal here but still like the restaurant. Service needs improvement and ask about parties that may be booked... I guess it will calm down after the holidays but still beware."

He kept commenting how unique and delicious the lemony dressing was. The salad was a large entree sized portion, which you don't always find when you order salad for lunch in Manhattan.  The decor is fun and as you'd expect if someone named Tommy Bahama lived there. The bathrooms were gorgeous, which is always a pleasant surprise in New York City restaurants.  Our server, Jared, was fabulous. Friendly, efficient, and very knowledgable about the dishes (my husband has food restrictions). He is an asset to their team!

The blackened ahi tuna salad was hands down the best of its sort I have ever had, and the chocolate cake thing I had afterward was so large and so rich I had to take half of it home. It came with a glass of champagne (I don't drink so I gave it to the waiter). It was not very busy, but it was lunch, on a Monday, that was MLK day, so it may have just been that, and tables started to fill up oddly early afternoon (like 1:30 or 2:00?).

Ate here Sunday night after being to Motown the Musical on Broadway.  While the waitress was really nice, my steak when it arrived was stone cold, as was the potatoes. It was replaced promptly with a new one, and was delivered by the Manager. Also a snack was provided while I waited.  Any establishment can have an off day, I get that,mite how the error is repaired that counts, and the guys here reacted positively.  Nice menu, and good staff.

Indeed, we had a nice experience tonight but it wasn’t “great”. That said, they must be doing something right given it’s TA ranking (which is why we chose it, coupled to its proximity to our Central Park hotel) plus how busy it was  The positives for me were:  Ambience and service - lively and attentive respectively  My french onion soup entree was very good - but OTT on the Gruyère but very rich and deep tasting  The fries and mash potato accompaniments were excellent  Why I personally am only giving an average score though is…  My moules marinere were a bit anaemic  My sons filet mignon was medium rare but super charred on the outside - for 61 bucks (expensive by UK and french standards but the norm in NYC clearly), it could have been better)  My wife’s salad chèvre chaud was ok - in france the goats cheese would typically have been grilled on the bread and the dressing was overwhelmingly tart  The wine list was average and exorbitant - we ordered a 76 dollar Sauvignon blanc (one of the cheaper ones) it was ok but warm - I asked for a ice bucket but it was only the last glass that got close to an adequate temperature  Long story short, nice setting, attentive friendly service, ok food

Best taco i've had in NYC hands down. Service was super fast and efficient. Hold onto your receipt from the upfront pay, you'll need it for the line. This is a pay-first and then build your taco with the line chef as you move down the line. Will absolutely go back.

I have had tacos in Mexico. Los Tacos is very similar to Mexican taco stands but with fresher ingredients and NYC’s tougher standards. The staff inspired confidence with efficiency and authenticity. Try the cactus tacos but their standards are what people come for.

On Saturday I stopped in during a very busy lunch service and when I saw the line out the door I thought “this is going to take forever”, but no. The line moves fast and I had just been handed my ticket at the counter when one of the guys who makes the tacos was waving to me to signal he was ready. I think I was out of there in 5-10 minutes. Their operation is an incredibly well oiled machine that I wish more places could learn from. I also read just recently that they even make their own masa for the tortillas, which is amazing. I knew they made the tortillas in house, you can see them making them behind the counter, but to even make their own masa is next level. May this place always exist and always be this great.

I was here 3 years ago. The prices went up, but still a great value. There are no tables or chairs. Stand up only with a high top. You place your order and pay. Prior you can choose Mexican sodas. Then take your slip and give it to the person making your taco. They top the tacos with onions, cilantro, salsa and guacamole sauce. You can get your own limes. I got the pork adobado (carne al pastor). Yes they use a trompo-that adds the extra crunch and flavor. This is also garnished with a pineapple strip. I suggest not to get the salsa. This way your flavor comes from the meat. My wife got carne asada. 3 tacos each were plenty to fill us up. $4.50. Carne asada was $4.75. We also had Horchata. Some of the best I ever had. I was spoiled with Mexican food because I lived in Dallas for 10 years. I had a few employees come to NYC and I suggested they go here. All said it was the best tacos they ever had.( Nothing like in Miami). These tacos are so good, I drove my daughter up from Florida to Boston, we seriously thought about driving into Manhattan for these tacos(would have if not for the parking issues)

The place was packed but it was a very well run, clean fast food establishment that provided great service. All employees were extremely patient and polite while they answered my daughters questions about the food. My family and I were very impressed. If you’re in the area, Los Tacos is worth a visit. You will not be disappointed. Thank you Los Tacos for a lunch I won’t ever forget! If I ever get back to NYC, I will definitely return.

There is a decent choice of food items and some cool drinks as well, so we tried a bunch of them. The food, as in the other locations we have been to, was simply amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Pity though that there was a huge fan blowing air straight onto our necks, and that made eating in an already crowded shop unpleasant. We ate very quickly and left. If you plan a visit, try to go in off-peak hours to enjoy your experience to the fullest.

We tried to enquire about the types of tacos as we wanted crispy taco’s that the lady behind the counter said ok but when they were ready, they were soft tortilla wraps. We honestly weren’t sure what we ordered but they both tasted amazing. Good for a quick bite on the go but not filling at all so you would need a few if looking for a substantial meal. I really enjoyed the food as it had loads of flavor but was disappointed that there was no seating and that we felt very rushed. I understand they want to get the queue down but need to take a bit more time listening to their customers and what they are after. Based on the taco’s alone I would go back if I am ever in NY again but think I would have to work out the menu and decide what I want prior to going so there is no confusion.

New York missed a place like this! This pizza is best.

I should not mention the waiter, unfortunately i forgot her name, she was so beautiful as well as professional. The location is great to, just by the Village.. lots of students all around and a very friendly atmosphere. I’ll be back

We saw a show at the Blue Note & were hungry for pizza afterwards. After walking around a bit, we stumbled on this place and I am sure happy we did! The place is small so be warned. We sat at a table at the back of the restaurant which is ok since a few other places we went to had an hour wait. This was a Friday night so you can imagine the neighborhood was bustling at 10:30. We ordered the 18” rustica pizza which was absolutely delicious. It’s a thin crust brick oven pizza that had fresh mozzarella, peppers, basil, and sausage. I definitely recommend this place for their pizza. I would come back another time to try their other dishes since their pasta dishes smelled & looked good at the tables around us.

With authentic (enough) Napoli pies, they offer a variety of toppings, gluten free and vegan options and offer 3 sizes. Their delivery is also on point and never disappointed.

Unfortunately, we were let down as the food provided, we deemed, was exceedingly average.  We arrived and instantly were put off by the overly loud music. This quietened down significantly as the evening progressed but it was impossible to hear the waitress when our orders were being taken. On top of that, our table wobbled and there was no wedge provided to help stabilise it. Being one of my pet hates, I bit my lip and just rode it out for the evening.  Secondly, the calamari starter was particularly greasy and the portion was far too big a size for just an appetiser. There was no indication on the menu that this portion could have easily have suited four people, let alone a couple.  The main next: a rustica pizza. Again, quite greasy and far too cheesy. The tomato, instead of being layered into the pizza with the cheese, was just dolloped on to each slice. It just wasn’t particularly impressive given that a lot of prior reviewers have claimed this restaurant boasts “the best pizza in NYC.”  My girlfriend’s gnocchi dish was reasonable but by no means awesome.  It’s a shame, given the high praise this establishment is given. My final and biggest complaint is that this restaurant DOES NOT accept card payments! We actually only overheard this information being passed on to other customers at a neighbouring table and were not informed of this upon arrival. We had no cash. So, we were directed to the RESTROOMS where an ATM is located - huh? How ridiculous. (This ATM also charges to $2.99 to allow you to withdraw cash!)  It is probably with no surprise you may hear we did not tip despite the staff hinting that we did. And, all in all, the experience and food was relatively forgettable.

I've been lucky enough to have some incredible pizza in different places in Italy, and this place definitely holds its own with them. It's very small- I booked a few weeks in advance and you'd have to. Our table was really small, but it was nice to be next to the pizza oven and see everything which was going on. The menu was so good we struggled to choose between toppings, so we had one of the massive pizzas with three different toppings. All were excellent, but the truffle one blew me away. The bottle of red we had was tasty and affordable. Our bill was about 90-100 dollars for two (but then we had the huge pizza which is supposed to be for four people!). Overall, if I was ever to go back to New York, I would definitely be coming here again.

One half was pepperoni and ricotta and the other five cheese. We ordered a bottle of wine which was very nice. We were a little worried as the table we were on was small and the size of the pizzas going past wee huge bit when it was delivered it fitted on the edge but the board it came on was so sturdy we did t need to worry.

Book your table!	We ate dinner here. It’s a cozy restaurant in Firostefani and an alternative to the caldera view restaurants because it relies on ambience and food more than caldera views. Certainly a very welcoming and helpful host and this place is rightly popular. We had booked in advance and that was a good job because there were many ad hoc visitors who had to be turned away as it was fully booked. The food is very homely and of a good standard. I am not sure where many reviewers below have dined but I would not consider the food rates as highly as many have described. Obviously tastes vary. We found it a very pleasant alternative though to many other places we visited in Santorini and it certainly comes at a significantly lower cost than pretty much anywhere with the view out over the caldera. Well worth a visit . But don’t forget to book, they are very helpful

Okay, you won’t get superb views of the Caldera as it is situated on the road down to Fira from Oia. However, the ambience, quality of dishes and friendly owner made up for the lack of view. There are only approximately twelve tables in this small restaurant so booking always advisable. The fish we had was freshly caught that morning and prepared to order. If you love fish we thoroughly recommend this restaurant; dishes reasonably priced as well. Various meat and local dishes were also on the menu. Note: only open in the evening.

It was off-peak season when my husband and I went and we got a reservation through our hotel. Boy am I glad we did because we saw about 10 couples get turned down for not having one. Almost every table was marked ""reserved"" when we arrived at opening.  There is a good reason for the reservations because the food is so delicious, so flavorful, and home cooked right behind the counter by the husband of the husband/wife team. The wife serves the food and takes the orders and she is SO friendly (unless you dont have a reservation).  They have a good wine selection and the menu is significantly large. I was feeling a little under the weather when we got there so I got a soup - oh my gosh - it was just a simple mushroom soup but we soaked up every last drop with the bread and she came over and hugged us because she saw me soaking up the last bit of liquid and laughed at us. But it was that good. We also got the tomato balls, a must for being in Greece, and they were served with tzatziki, SO GOOD. My husband complimented that for a fried food it was so light. We also got the beer chicken and a seabass - both were amazing, we finished basically everything. They also give a complimentary dessert (assuming they rotate). Ours was some phyllo dough with some cream maybe (not really sure) but so good. The wife also takes a picture of every table and puts it on her facebook site, which I think is pretty cool.  We wanted to go back a second time in our 3 dinners we had in Santorini, but then figured we should try something else....regreted not going back. Absolute must - please go you will not be disappointed."

The Octopus croquettes appetizer was really good, and we loved the bread and the butter and ricotta cheese. We then shared the razor clams with rice, and this dish was super fresh, and delicious.

The steak is incredible - this coming from someone who usually avoids steak (and beef in general), but the starter of cockles in garlicky broth was - if anything - even better.  They were a bit shorts on waiters, but the ones they had were great, and we got good advice on the wine selection too.

It was huge, perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious. The side order of grilled vegetables and fries was very tasty also.  Compared to UK prices, it was extremely good value. Probably about half what we'd have to pay at home.  The area is really cool as well. Loads going on with lots of bars, restaurants, and theatres. It's so nice we're heading back there tonight to try another restaurant.  I thoroughly recommend it.

I am an Argentine living in the U.S., so I know! We were in Buenos Aires for a week and despite the countless restaurants in the Palermo area, we just had to go back to this restaurant twice.  Try the classic ""provoleta"" as a starter. It is an Argentine staple, as is the chicken milanesa as a main course. For those who like something sweet and new, try their mashed sweet potatoes. They are not the same root vegetable as eaten in the U.S. It's sweeter and more fragrant. The dulce de leche pancakes for dessert are a great way to end a fabulous meal. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!"

It was worth it. We had a great meal and the servers were very helpful with describing the menu and offering opinions on our choices. Cheryl had the pulled pork and I had the skirt steak. We have learned that in Argentina the quality of the beef is very good and the vast majority is free range grass fed. BUT, almost all chefs have a tendency to over cook the beef compared to our North American standards so adjust your preference and clarify the redness / pinkness you want your steaks.

It was again a great experience. Not only the meat is great but also the portions are huge for my Brazilian standards. Our party of 6 ordered one salad, two chorizos, french fries, one entraña and one colita de cuadril (which in Brazil se call picanha). We ordered the colita because they did not have asado de tira which was our first option. All was accompanied by a penguin of malbec (they have 3 barrels of wine over the counter and fill half or one litter ceramic penguins to bring to the table). The meat and the chorizos were cooked to perfection. That is what a parrilla is about. We did not have problems with the service as mentioned in some comments. It was just correct. The bill including one shared ice cream with dulce de leche and service was AR$700, not bad at all. Go to La Dorita for great parrilladas...

It was recommended by someone I know in Buenos Aires. Personally, I thought the service was a little slow, and the food was only average. I do not think that I would return.  While not having a lot of bad things to say, I also do not have a lot of good things to say either.  I got to the restaurant about 9:30 on a Saturday evening. It was not easy to get a seat, and was seated immediately. About 10 PM, the restaurant appeared to be full.  The portion served was more than I could eat. However, I have a lot better meat at other places in town. The chocolate mousse that I had for dessert was quite good.  While the desserts may be good at Parrilla La Dorita, there are many other places to go in Buenos Aires to get a good steak.  Overall, I would not go back the Parrilla La Dorita.

I dined at a table outside; lots of shady characters hanging about so it wasn't a relaxing experience at all. If you must eat here then get a table inside at least.

The waiter spoke now english but brought to our table the size of 3 different steaks. We chose the Tenderloin ( like Filet Steak ) As mentioned in previous reviews, one steak shared between two is ample! A reasonable priced Pinot Noir was selected and advised by the waiter for £12.  A choice of mashed potato or thick chips as well as an extra of vegetables.  Total cost of meal for two inc wine £41.  We were so pleased, we visited again the following evening as we were unable to obtain a table at Don Julio although on reserve list for 3 weeks!

Firstly, really nice location and restaurant is modern and clean.  Menu is fantastic and reasonably priced. Waiter made some brilliant recommendations. Steak was absolutely sensational. I can not fault it.  Wine was also on top form - the Malbec recommendation I had was brilliant.  I would highly recommend this place.

Amazing steaks!	We stayed at a hotel nearby and the staff there recommended this restaurant. It was amazing!  You get an Argentine feel as soon as you enter... delicious food smells in the air, lots of wood decor, great ambiance.  Our Portuguese speaking server did not speak English however the menus had an English translation and with some pointing and hand waving we managed to order.  To say that the food was great would be a big understatement. Our steaks were the best that we had ever eaten! We are still talking about them and wondering if we'll ever have the chance to eat any that taste that good again. They were grilled and seasoned to perfection... not to mention VERY generous portions. The side dishes were plentiful and delicious as well.  And at the end of the meal, we were surprised by the bill... at how small it was! There were four of us dining and we had four steaks, four side dishes, a bottle of wine, a large bottle of beer and several bottles of water - our bill worked out to about $20 US each! Unbelievable for such a delicious and plentiful meal.  Needless to say we highly recommend this restaurant for an authentic Argentine experience and the best steaks you'll ever eat. If we return to Buenos Aires again, we will definitely dine here again!

It was good enough to try again, particularly after reading recent reviews. I was particularly taken with chazcat99’s review of Jan 20 where he said his wife’s salmon and shrimp ravioli was the ravioli they ever tasted. I love ravioli but have rarely had a memorable one. Particularly in a steakhouse. So I ordered it. This was by far the best ravioli of my life. I am sorry i have no photos. They were round, plump (they are rarely plump enough) with a delicious fresh tasting shrimp and salmon filling in an ok white sauce.,But best of all for me there were no doughy edges. Oh, i wish i had a photo-the whole pasta was stuffed. I’m going back again soon for more. Hubby had a good chorizo steak and grilled veggies. The veggies were onions, green peppers, tomatoes, zucchini all in big pieces, I had a glass of malbec. I find malbec kinda dull, you had one, you’ve had them all, but this was better than most.,

The steaks were cooked to perfection and very reasonably priced, as were the wines. Our waiter was Osvaldo and he was a very helpful and attentive waiter. At the end of the meal we were given a free glass of champagne with our dessert, a nice touch. We would have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant. Depending on the day and time people want to eat it may be advisable to reserve a table.

The fun starts with a waiter who enunciates his Spanish so carefully and predicts your responses so well, you’ll feel like a native. The food is great and the portions are ridiculously large (sharing one entree is a good option). Be Sure and order the grilled provolone salad; it’s not what you expect and is delicious. The ONLY downside was the Argentinian definitions of Medium and Well. Consider pointing to a picture on your phone of how you want your Steak since bloody and cold in the center is the local version of Medium.

We had really excellent steak here - we both had the bife de chorizo and the meat was among the nicest I have ever had at reasonable prices given the quality. The salad and fries and Malbec were very good too.  I would recommend booking this place and highly recommend the meat. There are plenty of other dishes beyond the steak including other meats and pasta too. It deserves the positive reviews it gets. Service was friendly with some English spoken and it’s a nice traditional style parrilla restaurant.  The locals on either side of us shared steaks rather than take one of their own. The bife de chorizo steaks are big enough for two to share. Apart from cutting the cost down it also leaves room for starters and/or desserts - that’s an option worth considering.

First, the beef is equal to Morton's, Fleming's, Ruth's Cris etc. You just get twice as much for a little less money (at the NAME restaurants). Not being a late night eater I choose lunch. I tried Don Julio, Calden and on a lesser known note Clarkes. All the steaks were fantastic. Ribeye, Lomo, Entrana. Clarkes was cheaper, Calden more warm and welcoming (thanks to Christian) and a fantastic pour of Vino Tinto. We shared the stuffed mushrooms, my wife loved the ravioli and my steak was perfect! Calden is my repeat choice.

UBER prices 6-7times higher rates than usual  Arrived on time at 930pm and greeted at bottom of staircase by server who spoke no English but gracious.  Upstairs we ascended to first floor and met other families and guests. Served bubbly wine and hung around WAITING for dinner for an hour. Tasty single appetizer offered for the hour.  1030pm Ascended another flight of stairs to warm/hot small room with basic tables and recorded music.  Served set menu (I believe they do offer vegetarian options) from Nicos' favourite winery I suspect. Not mine unfortunately.  Food was good as were wines - however AS FOODIE and lover of great wines would not have chosen this again as place to spend New Year's Eve. We were asked to use the same wine glasses from one tasting to the next - tacky. Home style cooking and presentation. Some dishes above average in taste - presentation average.  Desserts arrived as the clock struck 12 and we left shortly after.  While I would recommend this as REASONABLY priced wine/dine experience - and the food was good - I DON'T feel this listing deserves to rated number one dining location on TripAdvisor for BA.

The six course meal included Pan Integral Casero (a roasted eggplant dish), Berenjena Asada, caldo de Guanciale con Cinco Porotos (an excellent soup), Risoto Negro de Sepia, Adobo de Chancho (the star of the show in my view — a roasted pork dish that was best pork I have had), and finishing with Cheesecake de Especias (a homemade cheesecake with a tangerine topping(delicious). Each course was terrific and accompanying by well matched wines. The star in wine for me was the Desquiciado Garnacha 2021. Thank you so much everyone for a magical evening.

Each of 5 courses is described in detail and paired with thoughtfully chosen wines. The chef is incredibly knowledgeable of wines and the stories behind them. His background in some of the best restaurants in New York City offers an interesting perspective. If the food and beverage were not enough, the interactions and friendships made with the guests takes the experience over the top. Everything about the timing and the interactions and the flow of the evening has always seemed to be “just the right amount of everything“. Bravo!

Even though I am not the most social person, I have felt very comfortable with this experience. Dan and Henry make everyone feel at home. The food is superb and the wine pairings are excellent. In addition it is a great place to share your current travel experiences and obtain excellent advice and recommendations.

The food was as described on the SaltShaker site- decent home cooking. But other than the soup, none of the dishes were that great. The accompanying wines weren’t anything special either - just common, everyday wines in quality. The experience was more about being in somebody’s home and sharing conversation with a small group of people from around the world. At the price $80/pp plus tip, we found much better value elsewhere in Buenos Aires.

The ""puerta cerrada"" (or ""closed door"") movement is new to us, but we'll be searching it out more often. What sets Casa Salt Shaker apart (aside from the food and drink, but more on that later) is the communal table. While many closed door restaurants have gone to traditional restaurant style seating, Casa Salt Shaker has maintained their communal table which made for a delightful evening. We sat with 8 other English speaking guests from the US (living in Chile, and living in Alaska), UK and New Zealand. What a diverse and well traveled and engaging group!  Now - the food! Dan is a master in the kitchen! Three of us were pescatarians, so Dan made an entire pescatarian-friendly meal. The meat eaters among us were thrilled to take a break from their Argentine meat frenzy. We savored homemade bread, Peruvian ceviche, Timbuche (the most delicious cilantro/albacore soup I've ever had!), corn ravioli, pollack with chimichurri hollandaise, and pineapple cheesecake, along with perfectly paired wines. Along with being an extraordinary cook, Dan is also a wonderful conversationalist and we learned a lot about life as an expat in Argentina. Dan doesn't speak much English but is delightful with his shy smile and quiet demeanor. The $80 (US) that we spent each was an incredible value given the quality (and quantity) of the food and wine, No tiny tastes or mere splashes of wine here."

Every dish was attractively presented and absolutely delicious. The portions were perfect if not slightly large but everything was seasoned to perfection. The chef Dan brings vast food knowledge from years of experience, research, and from being a food writer. This is such a special experience that I strongly suggest you book it in advance as to not be disappointed if trying to do so after you arrive in Buenos Aires. When available, Dan also provides food-oriented day tours. We were lucky to spend a full day with him and it enriched our experience immensely as he has lived there for almost 20 years. His Spanish and English are perfect and he speaks several other languages.

The food was amazing, i don't eat raw fish but last night i could have licked my plate and asked for more. Absolutely delicious. As was the Brussel sprout bisque, again something else i wouldn't eat at home. Griddled white asparagus next with amazing homemade XO sauce.

Good food, amazing wine pairings, lovely hosts, and a nice cultural exchange. Casa SaltShaker is the most fun food experience I've had so far in South America.  A communal table is a great idea, plain and simple. You might have to be slightly outgoing to go here, but if you can bare the thought of meeting new, interesting people, and talking to them over food and wine, this is the place for you. I went to this in-house restaurant with a friend of mine, and we had a blast meeting people from the U.S., Germany, England and Argentina.  But over to the most important thing: the food and drinks. The night opened with an amazing yerba mate gin cocktail, accompanied by light conversation with our newly acquainted co-guests. Good whole wheat bread was quickly followed by a really good smoked mozzarella cheese starter. Like the rest of the meal, the dish was perfectly seasoned - and slightly spicy.  One of the two shining highlights of the night was the hummus and cauliflower soup, paired with an amazing chardonnay. A slight touch of chili gave the table a slight scare, but every spoonful made the soup increasingly more satisfying. This is the kind of soup I would like to keep 20 liters of in my freezer for comfort food emergencies.  The third dish of the night was the weirdest one. Burnt pasta with squid, tomatoes and eggplants. Some of the guests struggled with the texture of the pasta, but I didn't really mind. The flavors were exceptional, and the rosé wine pairing was surprisingly great.  The fourth course, the main course, was the star of the night for me. I hate when people overcook birds, but this night the stuffed quail was cooked perfectly pink. An amazing tahini sauce, the pancetta in the stuffing, the crunchy pomegranate seeds - everything came together to make a complete dish. A deep, rich cabernet sauvignon exemplified how wine heightens food.  For dessert, we got a juicy banana cake, paired with a rich chocolate mousse, peanut cream and a syrup with a chili sting. The paired dessert wine was not over-the-top sweet, and went well with the rich dessert.  I left the place stuffed, satisfied and happy. I would recommend Casa SaltShaker to anyone with an adventurous palate and an open mind. For the gourmets of the world: spend a night in this cozy house if you're in Buenos Aires.

Decent food, nothing really outstanding! Mediocre Wines.	"We had an OK night at casa SaltShaker, but in the end it was a disappointmet, because we  expected MUCH more.  First of all, the food was ok - there's nothing to complain about. However, it wasn't anyting really special. This is definitely NOT world class, in a city famous for its abundance of world class restaurants. Of course, this insight was a disappointment!  The best way to describe what I mean is:  If I was invited to a hobby cook's house and he cooked such a meal, it would be great. If however somebody pretending to be a knowledgable chef invited me to his and cooked this menu for me, I would clearly think that he was not trying nearly as hard as he could, but was saving efforts...  The Casa Saltshaker guys are definitely to be attributed to the hobby cook area...the problem is that TA rates them in the other category (and they think that they belong there...)  The HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT was however was the complete abscence of any personal interaction on behalf of the ""hosts"". When you ""invite"" somebody into your home and you do not wish to exchange even a word with your ""guests"", this is really a bummer. I had the feeling that they were desperate to put us through the process as quickly as possible, collect our money and send us home.  I certainly didn't feel welcome there.  Exemplatory for the attitude towards their guest was this episode:  Coming in I was thirsty and aksed for a glass of water. They rejected it by saying that they would start serving dinner in 10min. REALLY!? Is THAT hospitality?! No one had ever before denied me a glass of water :-)  Making up for the desaster that our hosts were was a quite nice mix of guests with whom we've had a fun evening anyway, despite the hosts (unfortunately not because of them :-)  Last but not least, the wine ""pairing"" we had with the meal was mediocre. We have had wine pairings in good places in Buenos Aires, so we know what can be expected in this price range. The guys either don't have a clue about wine or they simply don't care (I suppose it's the latter, because it fits the overall picture)."

The food is local and fresh, but this means that menu is constantly changing. It is quite possible that you may not be a fan of a specific course, but the overall pairing of wine and food is excellent. They accept up to 10 people per evening, so you get a nice social experience that is completely different experience from going out to a restaurant. We had six of us that night and ended up going out afterwards with a couple of people that we met that night.

Santiago is a charming host who immediately puts his guests at ease by explaining there are no correct pairings with food. Wine is very personal and the correct pairing is one that you enjoy. We had excellent dishes that were served with a variety of wines. For example, we were asked to taste and choose from three different vintages of Malbecs before we ate and again while we were eating. We found that our favorite changed when paired with our meal. Santiago, as a sommelier, gave us excellent background information on Argentinian wine regions and specifics of the wines served. The pairings included a variety of whites, reds and a “dessert” wine. It was an enjoyable evening with easy conversation with another nice couple and Santiago.

They really encouraged us to try different wines with different foods. The food was excellent, as was the wine. Sure it's not the typical restaurant experience, but get outside your comfort zone.

They serve a tasting menu with very reasonably priced wines to accompany it, or you can go a la carte and either choose a bottle or, again, ask them to recommend wines by the glass. In the wine list they will do 3, 5 or 7 glasses for a set price, so you know what you will be paying. The whole meal was very good value. I wasn't keen on one of the wines and Salvatore changed it immediately, without any hesitation.  The food was very good, but, as others have commented, the wine is really the star. A pleasant experience, although it is very intimate so difficult not to overhear others' conversations whilst you are dining.  The hosts are charming, a really friendly couple and both speak excellent English.  A word of warning about finding it: the street it is located on is very long, we nearly made the mistake of walking from our hotel in Palermo Soho, and it doesn't feel like a very safe neighbourhood. Our taxi driver mistook the address so had to drop us two blocks further down the road as it's a one-way street, and we didn't feel very comfortable walking, especially as we managed to miss it altogether at first. Make sure your taxi driver gets the house number right.

"Just enjoyed dinner at Casa Coupage last night. The tasting menu and wine pairings were fantastic. Dinner was served by a lovely waitress and all of our pairings were put together by Santiago, one of the owners and a sommelier. The ""closed door"" restaurant was in an unmarked house in Palermo, very charming. We selected the tasting menu ($350 pesos per person) and did 5 wine pairings. At the end we ended up receiving a total of 7 wines including a sparkling wine upon arrival and an extra white from Santiago. The pours were huge and I would highly reconmend doing the pairing (an extra $170 pesos) Dinner was wonderful but be warned we were there for 4.5 hours! You almost needed that much time to drink as much wine as we did! We also got totally wrapped up in a game of ""guess the essence from the sommelier kit"" with Santiago. Even still I wouldn't plan on leaving in much under 4 hours. We were there with friends so it was a great time and the food was fantastic. A very special dinner in BA."

Lovely experience.	"An old colonial era style house converted to a comfortable old style restaurant - elegant and calming. Is of the ""closed door"" variety so popular in BA so a reservation is required...  Food was lovely - small tasting dishes in a multi-course menu are probably the most interesting option. No huge hunks of meat here - dishes are all fairly delicate and of excellent size so you come away feeling satisfied but not stuffed.. The best bit is the wine pairings.. The owners are someliers/wine enthusiasts and offer a wine paring option with the menus where you can taste (copious, generous quantities) wines with each course; often 2 per course so that comparisons can be made... It's a really good intro to Argentinian wines for several different regions and grape varieties. And the price??? -- per head around U$D100....  Go. You won't be disappointed."

It is worth every penny. The staff is super nice and insightful on the food. My water was never empty once. The creativity here is 10/10. For the dessert course, we were moved to the 2nd floor in a private room since we had a group of 5. Very nice touches in the room. There were some dishes I liked more than others but I would definitely come here every time I am in Buenos Aires. Must make reservations in advance but definitely worth the wait.

I was served the multi-course tasting menu with wine pairings while seated at the chef's table. I received excellent service throughout, in English, with multiple staff serving, and a dedicated sommelier attending to both me and other guests.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the whole experience. For a visitor from the UK, this meal represented excellent value for money and so was an opportunity I could not pass up.

I have to admit that I’ve been to a few of these. I enjoy the opportunity to taste lots of different things and the surprise of what might come next. So when I was in Buenos Aires, I decided to try Aramburu.  A lovely ambience in the restaurant, and as expected of a fancy restaurant, the level of the service from the staff was superb. Ever attentive, always friendly. I was lucky to be sat at one of the chef’s table, facing the kitchen, and was able to witness the magnificent way the whole process seem to run so smoothly.  All that counts for nothing though if the food is not right, so what did I think? It didn’t start well. The starter course on the whole was a flop for me. They look amazing, but the taste just did not match. Take the soup & potato crisp that we started with. Both parts were way too salty. The next 2 plates of 3 bite-size food was underwhelming, and I really didn’t understand that carrot tartare. Why? From that first part, the only thing I really enjoyed was the baby goat in donut pastry.  Fortunately, things kicked up a notch after that. In sporting terms, the next 6 courses were absolute home runs. Oyster in coconut milk & granita, mushroom with egg yolk, shrimp & endive salad, fish with Jerusalem artichoke, quail, deer. Ah, heavens. I’m really not a salad person, so it comes as a surprise to myself that the shrimp & endive salad was one of the tastiest thing I’ve ever had. The combination of flavours and textures was just mind-blowing. The mushroom dish had such intense flavour. The quail was cooked to perfection. I could go on, but I’m making myself hungry. Suffice to say they lived up to the best dishes that I’ve had anywhere in the world.  After the amazing highs of the section I consider mains, the desserts were a bit of a come down. Don’t get me wrong they were not bad. The palate cleanser was smart & interesting, and both the pre-dessert and the main dessert were tasty, but they were just not spectacularly amazing, which was the standard that was set by the mains.  Given the quality of the food and service, the cost of the evening was really quite reasonable.  Overall, if there were some changes made to the starter section, this could very well best meal that I have ever had. I was very close to overlooking my dislike of the starters and giving it 5 stars, but I think it’s fairer to give it 4. If I’m back in Buenos Aires, I would go again, and cross my fingers that I can give it a full 5 stars next time.

What an amazing experience. I found Aramburu online and decided to visit from Australia. I can honestly say this place is worth the effort to travel to just to experience the amazing food and top service. We chose the tasting menu paired with wine. Each and every course along with cleansers and tasters were fantastic. The wait staff really made the experience special knowing the menu so well and being able to speak perfect English (helped my average Spanish :) ) The Sommelier truely made the experience. Her understanding and conveying of the wine was second to none. Even when asked for additional information and wine she was more than helpful. This place was so worth the trip from Perth to try. Do yourself a favour and treat yourself to a wonderful meal and experience by trying Aramburu. It was fantastic...

Every dish was delicious. Service was excellent and the wine served with the tasting menu was superb. Can't believe the very reasonable price.

This was truly one of our finest dining experiences in South America. If I lived in B.A., I would dine here whenever the menu changed.

The 18 courses were fantastic, my only complaint is that there is just too much food (I'd ditch a couple of courses ...the bread and one of the shellfish courses). The wine pairings were really great, staff friendly and knowlegable ... An excellent meal, save room for the popcorn ice cream.

Providing an 18 course tasting menu (with an optional wine pairing selection) this small venue (less an 20 tables) provides an intimate evening serving seasonal and delicious local food.  Service is friendly and attentive. All dishes are clearly explained and are uniquely presented. A great place for a ‘highlight’ meal. Try to enjoy this place before it moves to the more upmarket Recoleta area in March 2019.  Dinner takes about 2 hours. Sit back, relax and enjoy a wonderful taste experience.

The outside is so inconspicuous that you would walk pass it.  Nice interior with focus lighting on tables.  Good service.  1option: 18 courses with or with paired wines: took the paid wine option.  Cost:3900pesos  Food: the first serving is selection of crackers: all amazing followed with 6 bite sizes dishes. This included pumpkin log, scallops , pea in a pod, avocado on kale, duck pate with strawberry: all amazing.  Next it was bread with smoked butter- wasn’t particularly wowed by it.  Next came the bigger dishes: Beetroot with squid: interesting,squid was extremely soft. Scrimp on a hot stone : nice, interesting almost Tom yum like soup Fish with crispy skin : very good Chinese dumplings of goat with citrus : excellent Quail fried: excellent Beef: which was ok  3 deserts include: Grapefruit skin with jelly of Sauvignon Blanc and citrus: excellent Popcorn like desert : superb Lastly: a desert of meringue, coconut scrapings : again excellent.  Value for money: although pricey it is great value for money if you come from the UK,Europe or US where this meal would have cost double or triple .  It is one of the best meals of my life and can rival Michelin stars in Europe!

Blown away is an understatement. We were lucky enough to discover this place because our AirBnB was two doors down (literally!). You come across the front door, which looks like an abandoned storefront, ring the doorbell, then enter into the most intimate, romantic, charming place ever. You are blown away from the very first course. A truly artistic vision. And DELICIOUS! Each course is amazingly paired with wine. We ate and drank for 3.5 hours (a record for me!) but did not leave drunk or stuffed. Full and giddy would be a more accurate description. I truly hope you have a chance to visit this wonderful secret. And the price is surprisingly affordable (in American terms - we paid just over $100 per person).

This time, it was with my wife. We opted for the 20 course menu, paired with 6 wines. The bill came to about US$ 90 per head. The staff asked as we sat down if we had any food no-nos and, once explained, all the courses were adjusted accordingly with no fuss. Needless to say, each course was imaginatively presented and contained an unusual mixture of sumptuous flavours. Each time our wine glasses were empty, they were refilled without our needing to ask. We at at Baqueano's the following evening and neither of the aforementioned was the case. The wines were superb, especially the Susana Balbo White Blend. We can't wait for our next trip to Buenos Aires to visit again.

After that, we had the 'Copa Escocia' (Scotland Cup) that you will love.

Unfortunately they were out of lamb, which was our first choice. The steak was very good as was the wine selection. However, there were several things that affected our experience. First, one of the hostesses kept spraying an awful air freshener. It reminded me of being on an airplane in certain countries when they disinfect the plane. Horrible! My husband later learned that they were using it to camouflage a sewage problem they were experiencing in the men’s room. Our waiter started out great, but we never saw him after placing our order as he was then moved to serve a large party. Consequently we never had service again. We had to wait 40 minutes to get our check. A hostess noticed my dissatisfaction when leaving and asked if everything was okay. When I explained about the service, she just said they were busy. I think there are better restaurants to spend your money in than Cabernet.

Spotted this restaurant walking past at lunchtime and decided to return for dinner. I wanted an Argentinian steak! (For our last night in Argentina and also the last night of our 9 week round the world, once in a lifetime vacation! I was not disappointed, Jonatan recommended a lovely Cabernet Franc wine and looked after us supremely well. The sophisticated ambiance of this place is classic and relaxed. Ideal to dine in couples or groups. Don’t walk by this place or you’ll miss a great restaurant!

It was our first night in BA after a long long flight from Europe. We were wandering around in Palermo and when dinner time came, we looked around. We saw this place and it was very inviting. There’s a more formal dinner room with white tablecloths inside but as the temperatures were still mild we chose the inner leafy courtyard. Kevin had his first Patagonia beer and it became his favourite... We ordered also a bottle of Malbec from Cafayate. Smooth flavoursome. As we say in French “le petit jésus en culotte de velours”... And of course we had steaks. My husband’s thick entrecôte was grilled to perfection. A lovely crust and juicy inside. So tender. So tasty. I had a skirt streak. Amazing too. We undoubtedly understood the reputation of Argentinian beef! The best we ever had! It does put to shame the French Limousin and Charolais beef... We’ll surely come back there for our coming stay in Buenos Aires.

Cuisine “well presented” WHY 3 STARS: 1)We ordered two appetizers and two entrees.. the volume of food was enormous, however neither of us appreciated the taste of anything provided... and we are not food snobs or foodies as some call themselves. 2)We were charged for the napkins and bread provided on the table that we never requested! We travel the world and this was a first for us globe trotters. 3)We were charged for wine that we did not drink... this was promptly removed when we disputed the bill.. *** Great atmosphere... However overall, I would not recommend this restaurant to a friend without serious warnings regarding the overall package. RNelson (Austin,TX)

He listed it as in Palermo but it is really in Soho and quite a trek from our Palermo hotel – so we took a cab. It was in a part of this enormous city that we had not visited so it was great to see such a ‘buzz’ going on. The restaurant was quiet at 7.30 but filled up as the evening progressed. The food was pretty good but not mind blowing but at a reasonable cost and the waitresses that served us were a delight and very helpful.

Unfortunately they were not met.  Nice Restaurant in local design. Service is soso, not very attentive and not overly friendly.  Food is very disappointing, the salad was ok but the oil and vinegar they use is very low quality. The beef (I ordered a fillet) was not tender and the taste was not good. Also the side dishes were not good. Very disappointing as I know Argentinian beef can be fantastic.  I do not understand this restaurant is rated so high, for me a very average restaurant. I cannot recommend and will definitely not return.

If you’re into touristy ambiance, this is the place. The restaurant is decorated with eclectic items throughout. The food would’ve been better if the server didn’t insist on what we should order and how we should order. Having travelled in many places and eaten at many restaurants, I find it very annoying when server treats American as if we’ve never eaten foreign meals before. How foreign can steak really be!?!? I like the idea of the many different condiments and side items served with the meal on the first visit just to have the different tastes of flavors they offer but I wouldn’t care for it on my next visit. I would come here again but I would insist on ordering what I like rather than what the server insists. I would be more selective on the side items rather than many different items that I don’t care for. For dessert, I ordered a flan which was overwhelming even for 3 people. Flan is already very sweet but they served with large portion of dulce leche.

We also ordered papas frittes, which looked delicious but we were so pleased they didn't come. The wine list was great and we enjoyed a nice bottle of Malbec. After our meal we were so full so no dessert. La Cabrera Norte was one of our favorite restaurants in BA. Definitely check it out.

Steak! Did I mention steak?	"Thoroughly enjoyed this adorable restaurant. Family of four.  We ordered two steaks and two salads - typically we have a gigantic appetite for steak and it was a huge amount of food - we suggest you SHARE STEAK AND ONE SALAD MAX PER FOUR PEOPLE.  If you are used to American Caesar salad we suggest passing on this, as their version wasn't what we are used to. Take a look at the other salads as they pass by - very large and deconstructed style. They offer half portions.  The decor of this restaurant was great with drawn on plates by past customers covering the walls and small air planes and toy blimps along the ceilings. It was filled with tourists but we didn't find it ""too touristy"".  The wait staff were very lovely and kind, spoke English very well.  Our only criticism would be that the food seemed to be rushed - the salad, steaks, and sides all came rushing to the table all at once very quickly overwhelming the table.  Would suggest this to our friends in the future !"

We ordered two different chicken dishes, while we waited were served a plethora complimentary items, all very tasty and almost worth visiting for alone. Also the service was very good (something quiet uncommon in Argentina). We were a little put off by the paper table cloth and ikea style glasses, I think at this price they can do better.  Still we were really happy until the mains arrived, these we exceptionally dry, fatty and tasteless. If I had cooked that at home I would be apologising to my family. One dish was virtually inedible because it had been crisped so much on the outside and the inside was tasteless. Very disappointing.

The closed-door restaurant was a foreign concept to us and sounded intriguing when I saw it on TripAdvisor. There were two other couples who joined us so it was interesting meeting new people. We were at the end of our two week trip in northern Patagonia so had tried nearly everything already somewhere else along our journey. But it was nice to have a great variety of offerings all at once between the charcuterie tray, meat appetizers, provoleta, main beef dish, and dessert. The dessert was something new and very tasty. Our provoleta was overcooked and drier than all the others we had eaten over our two weeks in region. The commentary Luis provided was professional and educational and it was nice to be able to go watch the cooking in action. I would recommend the experience to first-timers to BA.

Asado-the Argentinian custom of sharing good food and barbecued meats- a tradition that we now love! We also had never experienced a ""Closed-Door dining experience"" where the address of the restaurant is provided to you with your reservation confirmation and you arrive at the address, which is an unmarked door- you ring the bell- give your name- and you are granted entrance into a very special dinner! Luis explained everything we were going to eat... He told us about the 5 wines that would be paired with the 5 courses- he then showed us the FABULOUS pieces of Argentine beef-did I mention that we each got 32 ounces of this mouth watering steak? We had 12 people at our dinner. We were the only people who didn't speak Spanish-it didn't matter one bit! Luis told the two of us everything in English and the people we shared our meal with made us feel welcomed-we all laughed and talked for almost 4 hours! The food was incredible and the company was better! If you are in Buenos Aires, I highly recommend that you grab a reservation for this dinner so you can experience Luis's hospitality first hand!"

When the tour company booked us for dinner at Steaks by Luis in Buenos Aires, I had no idea it would be this incredible. We arrived at the restaurant just before 8 pm - a locked door with no signage or indication of what was to follow. We were handed a glass of sparkling white wine and met our fellow diners and set out on a gastronomic journey over the next three hours. A five course meal with exquisite wine pairings from, where else, but Mendoza. There is only one sitting, with a maximum of 8 guests all sharing stories and great food cooked, or grilled, to perfection. This was a dining experience, not just a meal.

We don't know what the ""house"" is like except through reviews, but the ""holiday"" version is in a first floor restaurant-like commercial space that did not convey ""house."" It was modern, clean and well lit for sure, but it holds 25 people so that's quite a crowd. On our particular night, half of the crowd was a group that already knew each other so they sat together on one half of the long communal table. They didn't really mingle as, well, they didn't have to. So there was less over-all mingling than we were hoping for. That said, the non-group people around us were delightful, engaged and pleasantly interactive (folks were from all over the world). The food itself, however, was AMAZING, the best or near best meal of our 12 day trip to Argentina. Luis is a bit soft spoken but he gives a nice introduction about the elements of a ""proper asado"" before he fires up the grills and then another member of his team, a highly fluent (in english) young man who is well versed not only in food but politics and culture, acts as host and service captain. Every course is outstanding. The wine pairings well chosen, and the pours generous. Luis circulates a bit as things progress, which is nice. By 11pm when the dinner ended, the lack of intimacy had softed a bit due to the otherwise happy experience. If you are travelling during the winter holidays, check the website or inqure to see if they are doing this larger group thing again. Don't for an instant hesitate based on food/wine/service alone."

They just mover location in BsAs. We checked the outside out before and found the place (not so easy). Arriving in time as required explicitly, many foreigners waiting, seemed a bit a cruiseship tour of overspending retired world travelers, not the hip and young people we like to be with... anyway. There was a power breakdown at the start... and not a real nice process to find a place to sit, instructions chaotic. Anyway we paid 200 USD for an experience but were quite disappointed. A minimal sald, some starters of low quality and undescribed and some cheese to be shared and a so-so quality steak (very low on our list of previous experiences in the USA or Colombia or Brasil or France). Dessert also average. Overall very disappointing to us. Fortunately the rest of our holidays really compensated for this bad start in a former garage without windows. Not recommended, though friendly people (who make an awful lot of US dollars instead of pesos).

The host, speking english, took care of anyone of us, trying to unify the group and explaining the Argentine asado, its many rituals and traditions, in a closed-door setting. If you're lucky and your neighbors pleasant, you can make friends and enjoy the dinner. Frankly speaking, having to relate is a little bit forced. However you can move around the restaurant, the terrace, the grill. The 5-course Asado includes a traditional picada, salad, achuras, steak, dessert. As already said, food quality was high, even if not the best we had in BuenosAires. In the meantime, the price is very high. So the quality/price ratio was not so good."

Why not grilled vegetables instead? I would have loved to have something grilled as well. My husband said his steak was just ok and not as good as he thought, he came with very high expectations. That being said, our host was fantastic and very knowledgable! He went out of his way to make sure everyone was having a good time and well taken care of. We also enjoyed getting to talk to people in the family style sitting at dinner. We sat next to a lovely couple. Would recommend for those wanting an asado experience.

"I'm really glad we opted to try Steaks by Luis. We made the reservation about a month in advance of our trip to Buenos Aires, which was a stopover on the way to Ushuaia and our Antarctic expedition. As many reviewers have already mentioned, it's one of those ""closed-door"" restaurants that is in a fashionable loft and only takes place a few times a week. No sign - just a staff member outside to assure you you've found the place! My boyfriend and I actually walked from our hotel to the restaurant (we needed the exercise to help burn off the calories) - about 4.5 miles (7.25 KM)! We made just in time and were welcomed in to find appetizers (cheeses and cured meats) and a sparkling wine. We had some time to mingle and meet the hosts and to view the meats that would be grilled up for our other courses - deliciously beautiful! At a certain time (a little after 9 p.m., I guess) we were instructed to take our seats. We sat down across from an American couple who - it turns out - were heading out on the same Antarctic expedition we were booked on and had posted on a TA forum thread we started! And the couple to my right (from China) were also on the same ship! I would say that pretty much all 20 or so guests were either from English-speaking countries or spoke English so, while you probably won't meet many locals at SbL, you will have plenty of people to talk to! In fact, as in our case, you never know who you might meet! I actually loved the communal dining aspect - it made the time spent at dinner that much more enjoyable.  The food was amazing. We had a salad with cheese and apples along with a nice wine for the second course. The third course was the most interesting: a mixed grill of identifiable sausages and other meats, plus a few that were *mysteries* to some of the diners. They want you to try before you judge because many people avoid certain parts of the cow/pig on principle. Haha. Some of it I liked, some of it I didn't; everyone had an opinion, but most people were game to try all of it. Plus, they served a grilled provolone cheese that was amazing.  The steaks - the main course - were large (12 ounces); I couldn't even finish mine! It came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes that were scrumptious. But I made sure to leave room for the dulce de leche cheesecake, which was both beautiful and heavenly to the palette. Mmmm, mmm! Did I mention we had wine with all these courses? And it just kept magically refilling?  All in all, this is an experience you won't regret and I think it is actually a really great value for the attention and service (and food) that you get. It is a 3+ hour meal during which you will never be bored!"

Luis and his team was great - making everyone feel at home and comfortable and Luis was even so kind to let guests turn the steaks and interact whilst preparing the food.  Everything was delicious and the setting beautiful in this 'secret loft' in Buenos Aires. It was one of our highlights whilst visiting Buenos Aires and can definitely recommend this wonderful experience.

The night began with a toast and traditional appetizers while mingling with other guests and staff. We continued by a nice presentation of the food and an introduction to the evening by the staff. Next, we sat down for a wonderful dinner - each part of which was superb. My boyfriend's favorite part of the evening was being able to head outside on the balcony with Luis, who showed him grilling techniques and talked about his experience with gastronomy. The food, wine, and company were all wonderful, and we loved being able to meet people during such an enjoyable experience - we have even kept in contact with a few! The staff was absolutely fantastic. Luis was happy to share his knowledge, Pierre was knowledgable and very interesting to talk with, and the rest of the staff was superb as well.

We were joined by five other diners at a communal table and the food, ambiance and service were great.  Upon arrival you're presented with a class of champagne and offered a selection of bread, cheese and meats. Once everyone arrived, you're brought into the dining room facing the open kitchen and windows that look out onto a terrace where Luis is preparing the wood grill. Before the first course, the fresh cuts of meat and cheese are presented and explained.  Each of the four courses are paired with a local wine which is generously (and continuously), poured. There was so much food and the delicious steaks were so huge that no one was able to finish everything beyond the salad course. I found the $75 per person price more than reasonable given the quality and quantity of both the food and wine.  Steaks by Luis is a closed door restaurant so you must make reservations in advance. Our email inquiry made on the website was responded to promptly.  It's easy to see why Steaks by Luis is one of the highest rated restaurants in Buenos Aires. Luis and his staff take great pride in what they do and it shows in every way.

Great presentation and selection of foods that would satisfy most palates for breakfast. We ate there four mornings and the staff was excellent. Lunch on the day we arrived was also very satisfying. We ate dinner at the St Regis one evening and found it to have a lot of interesting food that tended toward Michelin. Unique reconstructed food. Not had norm. Worth a try. The view of the city shows the energy of Buenos Aires.

The service as first rate. Nothing was too much trouble. The food was superb - all three courses. This was our last night in BA and we had eaten some steak prior to this but were left disappointed by them - the steak here was the opposite - a fillet steak which was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. My husband is not one for taking photos of food but on this occassion the presentation was just amazing. Don't recognise the experiences posted by other reviewers recently.

We were not disappointed and were taken to a table overlooking the Main Street. As it was only 7.30pm (Argentinian’s don’t eat until 8 or 9pm) we had the place too ourselves. Leonel our attendant spoke good English so ordering was a breeze. Food and wine are so cheap and of such quality it really only comes down to what your taste buds are up for. Small glasses of Sav were the only disappointment, come on Sheraton catch up to other local restaurants who give you a proper size glass of wine. Anyway the MOW tucked into the biggest chargrilled octopus tentacle I have ever seen and I settled for the braised rabbit, both excellent and of large proportions. Just had to have an excellent red from the Cafayete region, much better than Mendoza reds. Mains were rabbit done in pastry and aged steak accompanied with sweetbreads, hmm not really me...Dessert was a grilled banana in its skin with a caramel sauce and a parfait, bloody delicious. Any way service slowed down as more people arrived and the staff were stretched, however they made up for it by providing an excellent champagne FOC. Well done Leonel.

The food was inedible in parts and acceptable canteen style food at best which just didn't match the arrogant and often unfriendly wait staff. Besides one very charming, eager young waiter who was happily training his English while working on our Spanish at the same time, there were quite a few older ""supervisor"" type staff members around who mostly did nothing but chit chatting to each other. The meal had wine included and we had even double confirmed in writing that indeed all wine is included but alas, in the end one of these supervisors had nothing else to do but tell us upon leaving that ""only half a bottle per person was included and you drank two bottles in total"". Then he pretended to be super generous by telling us ""But that's okay, for you I will take it off the bill"" clearly fishing for big fat tip. Well- not for that ""my friend"", we left without tipping a single cent on purpose while we had originally intended to leave some money. All in all, extremely disappointing experience."

This is our 3rd location in New Zealand and we finally found a restaurant that appreciates flavorful dishes. This is a tapas style restaurant.

The calamari, chorizo and potatoes had a wonderful flavor also. Also was looking for a nice green salad - like a Greek salad with olives, roasted tomatoes, cokes- perfectly satisfying.  Staff was very busy yet never ignored the customer's needs. Highly recommend! Maybe we'll revisit when we go to Christchurch!

It served 4 of us nicely. I will definitely be ordering this again next time I am in Queenstown.

Absolutely divine. As soon as you walk through the doors, your senses are smothered with a beautiful lamb scented smell. Word of warning, they only do one size, large shoulder roast (with potatoes and gravy). This is enough for two adults or a family. I bought one for myself as I was travelling solo (yay, no wife and kids). It gave me dinner, breakfast and a snack after snowboarding the next day. The flavours were lovely and worked well together. The gravy and potatoes were nice and the lamb was pull apart, melt in your mouth. Do yourself a favour and try this with your friends and family. The site is about a 10 minute stroll from Central Queenstown (Fergburger as a reference) so its easy to get to. A really nice lamb dinner.

Both of us love Lamb and were looking forward to trying New Zealand Lamb. And we were not disappointed for we had many lamb meals on our tour of New Zealand and Pedro’s was the best Lamb meal by far.  The whole slow baked lamb shoulder is seasoned with rosemary & garlic and served with a side of scalloped potatoes. Its advertised as a meal to share BUT it takes a big appetite to shift half your share. It’s a fair old walk from the town so take care as it is a busy road but well worth the effort.

Lamb shoulder and boulangere potatoes - take it or leave it. What a marvellous business model!  Meal costs $45 and the meat will easily serve 3 (could stretch to 4 but then you’ll be light on spuds). We had ours delivered to our motel room for an $8 supplement (credit card accepted with phone order), which not only saved me the effort of finding them but also meant the food was with us sooner than I could have got it myself! Full marks for service.  The lamb was incredibly tender although not as flavoursome as that offered by a certain Gourmet restaurant in Wanaka, but had we not eaten there I too would give this five stars [as a take-away].

We were very impressed by the offering and by the people. Pedro's provides a slow roasted lamb shoulder together with cooked, sliced potatoes, which we call scalloped potatoes at home. We had choices to make: we could consume our order at the picnic tables outside the store; or we could have our order delivered to our accommodation for an additional $8 or we could pre-order and pick up (takeaway?) the meal package at a prearranged time. We opted for the last choice. We had time therefore to explore the Skyline Gondola prior to our return and mealtime. When we returned, our order was not yet ready so we had time to go across the street to the grocery and acquire ""happy hour"" and salad fixings. Returning to our ""home,"" we dined. The meat literally fell off the bone. It was moist, tender, and delicious. The potatoes were fully cooked but firm and not mushy. It was sufficiently abundant to feed 4 hungry adults. Costing $45, it was tremendous value. We later discovered another Pedro's in Christchurch when we arrived there and so surmise that it is a chain operation."

We ordered three shoulders of lamb enhanced with rosemary and accompanied by potatoes (not roasted but sliced baked with the lamb).  There were smallish loaves of bread to accompany the meal available from Pedro's.  Good family sized meal for mum, dad and two. Staff showed us the meal size when we went to order.

Well flavoured, easy to eat. Love the atmosphere of the small bar/small food joint scene and this place is small and rocking.  The banter from the staff was epic as well. Overall a great experience.

Range of fillings. The tacos are made in corn tortillas and are not stodgy. Price wise - around $8 a taco with a saving of around $1 per additional taco that you order. Service was fast, friendly and efficient. Once the tacos arrived there was a choice of three sauces - the hot one was reasonably spicy, which is unusual for NZ. Highly recommend it.

It is a very busy Italian restaurant and bookings are essential but I think it is trading now on past excellence. The restaurant is on the small side and we were crammed into a small table for 2 right at the back of the restaurant. Given menus and told specials and then took a while to come back for our drink order. We gave our food order at the same time. Our shared entree arrived fairly quickly and before we had finished it, our mains arrived. I commented that we had not completed our entree - no reaction and main meals pushed onto the table. Our entree was dough balls which were ok - really bread rolls with olive oil. For mains we had spaghetti carbonara and zucchini fusilli. The pasta is said to be home made and it was nice but the sauces served with both meals was lacking and the meals were not very hot. It felt like we were expected to eat up and get out as soon as possible so they could fill the seats again. Better places to eat in Queenstown.

Another special meal! We really were craving authentic pasta and were lucky to score a reservation. Terrific food and great service from start to finish. Many places we’ve been to seem to thrive on chaos, but this place seemed very well run and the manager was completely cool. My husband and I shared the Caprese salad, and then we each had a pasta dish. Finished off the dinner with dessert and coffee.  You def need a reservation, but the meal is worth the advanced planning.

Really recommend booking in advance as we sat in the front window area and watched countless walkup people turned away due to capacity. Bella Cucina is only a small restaurant with the kitchen/pizza oven centre to the room. The menu changes almost daily to some extent, and is not extensive but covers you for choice nicely. Don't load up on bread first (the garlic bread is a pizza size) as the main dishes are plentiful servings. Gnocchi was terrific. Dessert of tiramisu was excellent. The staff member at reception and serving tables was so calm, unflustered and efficient, always with a smile despite the constant queue of people out the door. Would definitely recommend and return.

We didn't know how delicious it was going to be.. We took the degustation menu with the matching wines and it was the best choice ever! Everything was well explained by Geo, our amazing waiter. It definetly the place to go when you're in Queenstown. Everything was perfect : bar, restaurant, service until the end of the night. Thank you for having us!

Decided to do a la carte rather than the degustation menu as we preferred the choices. Both of us really enjoyed each of the three courses and the service. Cocktails and beer selection great too! The Belgian waiter was particularly helpful. We consider the prices good for the quality of food. Just under $300 for 2 of us including drinks. The only thing that was not great was that every other table seemed to get a recap of the contents of each dish when brought to the table; on all 3 courses for us this didn’t happen.

We chose the Bunker based on the menu and the cozy atmosphere and for the extensive cocktail list. It was easy to make a booking online which is essential as the restaurant is small . The cocktail bar is upstairs and has a large fireplace which on this night had a roaring fire. The bar has comfortable seating with leather deep buttoned couches. We had a MaiTai and a Toblerone which were delicious. service was good. The restaurant is downstairs through a secret door! The wait staff were very good. As stated the restaurant is small maybe 10 tables. We were seated at the back of the room with one other table behind us. The young lady on that table kept up a running commentary and we could hear everything she said! We didn't hear her partner at all so can only surmise she was talking loudly. For starters we had the Duck liver parfait which was really good and the Southern Ocean scallops which were also excellent but for $28 would have expected more than just 2 smallish scallops. There should have been at least 4 for that price. For mains we had the beef and the pork belly with pork loin. All competently prepared with flavoursome jus but the pork had no crackle. What!! pork belly with no crackle it's the best part!! We had 2 glasses of wine. 1 pinot gris and 1 Shiraz. We were too full for dessert. Had this been a memorable meal??? Probably for the wrong reason of the 2 scallops!! It was certainly good and in a tourist town like Queenstown they do appear to take pride in the food and their business. For a special night out it is worth it.

I personally didn't love the space which was quite dark and cramped so I feel this would be more of a winter dining destination (as it is cosy) than a summer one. We would have liked to check out the bar too but did not manage to do that on this occasion. I think, when we dined here previously (many years ago) that we had our meal on the upper level where the bar now is. I was keen to try some cocktails and was told that not all cocktails made in the bar were available in the restaurant and I wasn't sure why but that's ok. I did have 2 very nice cocktails whilst there (pink diamond and a dessert cocktail as I had no room for dessert after the amazing entree and main). Both myself and my husband had the Paua entree which was sublime and we then had mains as follows: Hubby had the beef which was divine and I had the duck which was exquisite. I can't recall the exact side dishes we had but we had 2 and they complemented our mains beautifully. Wine: the wine list was good but not amazing and somewhere as 'exclusive' as The Bunker should have a better selection IMHO.

We had the proof on our phone that it was indeed their error. The great thing is that they handled this issue professionally and without fuss. We were taken upstairs to the cocktail bar for drinks and to wait while they shuffled things around to accommodate us. We were so relieved as we had been looking forward to coming here for ages. Finally we were seated in the restaurant and had a lovely evening with lots of delicious food. We especially enjoyed the starters - the scallops and the hare. The hare unfortunately had a couple of rogue bones but it still tasted amazing. For dessert we shared a beautiful fondant and they also gave us the petit fours seeing as the first attempt at our fondant had apparently collapsed. The Bunker is a wonderful restaurant and they know customer service.....any place can have issues but it is how they handle those issues which demonstrates the quality of their service.

The selection of wines is outstanding and the bespoke meals are great combination of the best ingredients and artistic skills of the chef. The cocktails and whisky to finish the evening just added to the festivities.

Friendly service had a bit of wait to get drinks and order in and eventually meals but well worth the wait. Diners could chose the degustation option with or without matching wines , we chose to order separate, For starters my wife had the tuna with crayfish rolls in a broth while I had the Scallops, which turned out to be the best flavoured dish & most popular by customer choice. For mains I had the duck while my wife had the Venison which was the better of the 2 & other diners at a nearby table also agreed. We did not order dessert as we had a reasonably large & late lunch. I am gluten free but chef has plenty of options, also a non drinker, great mocktail options also available. A little noisy with the small room size but cosy & warm with the inside wood fire. Still would return again, would rate 4.5 due to slightly slow service but gave them a 5 star as only option available.

"My wife and I were lucky enough to first experience The Bunker on a trip to Queenstown back in 2002. We were quite surprised that after such a long time the restaurant was still making memories for locals and tourists alike.  This is not a restaurant that you decide to drop in on at the last minute. It's often booked out well in advance and sports around 7 or so tables for a very intimate dining experience with friends or loved ones. In fact, we booked over a month in advance to make sure they could seat our party of 5.  Plan to take your time and this is one location that it pays to trust the kitchen, as they have a fantastic degustation menu, featuring ingredients from the South Island of New Zealand. Matching New Zealand wines are also on offer and in my opinion you're missing a fabulous experience if you choose to à la carte.  We started the evening with cocktails followed by a dish titled ""Amuse"" - described as a daily creation or local delicacy. On this day, we were served a starter of Cervena Venison. It came cooked perfectly with 3 beautiful contrasting sauces.  The next dish was a choice from the Southern Ocean or Marlborough region, scallops or wild boar respectively. I chose the boar - Mille Peuille of apple, parsnip remoulade with a well matched Amisfield Pinot Gris from Central Otago.  The next course hailed from the West Coast or Bannockburn - Conit of baby abalone, or Seared Loin of hare and braised leg. The hare was served with confit kumura (New Zealand native sweet potato), sour cherries, kawakawa jus and a Surveyor Thompson Pinot Noir from Central Otago.  A nice little citrus sorbet followed as a palate cleanser.  The Main course was either a Centrol Otago Alpine Merino lamb backstrap and braised neck, or Nelson sourced seared pink snapper. The Merino Lamb was spectacular, served with baby vegetables, pea sponge, thyme jus and a Church Road Reserve Merlot/Cabernet blend from the Hawkes Bay.  Dessert was a classic New Zealand kiwi fruit pavola with local fruit and mascarpone with a Brancott Letter Series Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough.  Lastly, we were treated to a local cheese selection with figs, nuts and a Cloudy Bay Late Harvest Riesling from Marlborough once again.  The wait staff were fantastic. Every course was described in detail and the quality of service was second to none.  Treat yourself to an experience and make sure The Bunker is on your list when you next visit Queenstown.  Highly Recommended."

We were a group and ordered 2 starter/platter dishes. The platters arrived and the basis of the platter was “chips” - fried potatoes!!!! There were some mini pancake rolls, some soggy samosas and salad and carrots. $28 per platter. We should have left at that point or rejected the platters but as a group we decided to stay. The main courses came out and in essence.....was not a Thai meal - just Asian cooking. The sweet and sour pork was literally hardly any chicken - just a large quantity of pineapple in a sauce. Utterly disappointing and not a place to return to for a “Thai” meal.

Our experience was average and we’ve eaten Thai food in lots of different places. Lots of fried food which we’re averse. Tastes and flavours weren’t anything special but portion sizes were very generous; meals were nice and hot. We had a large family next to us that had farmed their children onto a table beside us and the youngest sat there for our whole meal playing a tablet game with the volume turned right up and no-one was remotely worried about it - neither the family or the restaurant staff. That was a little annoying having the tablet music playing. Would have been nice if staff had asked them to turn down the volume. Overall experience was less than optimal. Wouldn’t eat here again, mainly because the food wasn’t anything special, which surprised us based on other reviews. We ordered two of the specials including pork belly and it was pretty oily.

The vegetarian starter included fried spring rolls, which are unusual in a Thai restaurant (they usually have the type with rice paper that are not fried), and deep fried, battered vegetables, which in my view defeat the purpose of eating vegetables. I did not order wine, but my friends did not care for the wine selections--surprising since it is not difficult to find good wine in New Zealand. The wait staff was good-natured, but not at all knowledgeable about wine.

We were the only ones there and they gave us the option of indoor or outdoor balcony seating. We sat on the balcony and enjoyed a nice sunny Queenstown afternoon. The service was very attentive and the food we had was nice and flavoursome. I’d recommend the Chicken Pad Thai for sure. Prices were fairly typical for Queenstown. Not too expensive but not inexpensive either.

Of note was the lemon, ginger honey tea which was very refreshing - not from a bag!  The food menu has a range of specials ( including blue cod) alongside the usual suspects - curries and noodle dishes. The service was very proficient with each member of staff having a specific role. The food did not take very long at all. Portion wise - satay chicken was 4 skewers and the mini vegetable rolls and tempura was more than enough for two. The mains were a reasonable size and are good value for money. My partner had his usual of yellow curry and you could taste the base ingredients and there were chillies in it, not a common sight in NZ. Both dishes had a good tingle to them and you don't have to ask for a spice level, instead cooked to the level as per the dish.  We didn't book and got a table immediately. They also do take away and have a special $10 menu.  Overall, tasty, good menu and excellent staff.

In all a reasonable meal, but there are probably better options in Queenstown.

Tanoshi doesn't take bookings alas so we tried our luck on a Sunday night... 45 minute wait alas! There are literally only about 6 tables inside so no wonder it's busy. All good, they took our number and called us when the table was ready. The food is perfect for sharing, super tasty and great variety. The ribs were incredible!! I've only given it 4 stars because at times service wasn't great... We never got the green tea we ordered and it took a lot to flag down a waiter for more food (despite the place being almost empty by the time we got in). I'd still highly recommend it as a spot to eat though!

Big gin and whiskey offering too, generous portions, fast and efficient service.  Well worth it…but not especially „Cheap“…..

She was very pleasant and charming with our daughter. The food took 15-20 minutes but it was worth it. The photo doesnt give much justice as it is looking way better on that night. Lol. The size was just right and it was cooked to perfection. The price is reasonable and worth it.

Eventually we found it and the entrance, not easy with all the roadworks in the centre of town at present. That was the only ropey bit of our visit.  We were seated in the garden area which has lovely ambience with hanging plants and great views out of all the windows. Service was good considering they were busy (Labour Day).  I had the lamb skewer - wow what a dish with the lamb chunks hanging from a skewer suspended over the plate. I got the waitress to remove the chunks and the hanging mechanism as I knew I would have an accident with it! The lamb was absolutely delicious, so tender. I would definitely have that again. Our son had the eye fillet and his was also really really good. My husband had the mussels as a main course - the mussels were small but lots of them and he rated it excellent. Unfortunately the Flambe baked Alaska was off the menu, so I had the Butterscotch Date Pudding which was really good, our son had the interesting chocolate sphere which he enjoyed, and my husband a good Irish coffee.  Of course being a public holiday there was a 15% surcharge on everything, but we had gone anticipating it. We all agreed we would definitely go back there again for a special meal.

What a fantastic place to eat! Especially if you love steak or ribs (half rack so there was room for dessert). We had both and they were delicious. My husband is fussy about his medium rare steak and this was cooked beautifully. We also had the Aromatic chicken and the way that was presented was amazing. The bombe Alaska was pretty special not to mention deliciously decadent. A great drinks menu as well - fabulous! The wait staff were so friendly - wait staff can either make or break your meal, regardless of how good or bad the food was, and the team here were great - super helpful with the menu, happy to have a quick chat and a joke. If you want a special dining experience, put Flame on your list!

The salmon was super tasty and cooked to perfection with a fresh addition of Fennel and radish as sides. I paired it with the pea/broccoli/mint/feta side. Equally delish. All in all a very nice dinner experience.

We’ve been in NZ for 10 days and this was one of our top 3 meals: outstanding food coupled with superb service.  Believe them when they say a large plate is good for sharing. We shared a dozen oysters (small plate) and then my husband and I each got a large plate because we like different things. The chicken thigh is def shareable. It came with a veggie medley of fresh peas and chopped zucchini with a lovely mint flavor. DH had the whole baked sole, probably not too much for one person. We did get the peas/broccoli/baby spinach side - very nice substitute for a salad and also shareable.  But the best part was the Pavlova - especially shareable and just to die for.  Public was really busy but our server - actually the entire staff - never missed a beat.  This place is a must if you are in Queenstown.

It was very busy for a Tuesday morning. Ordered bubble n squeak which was delicious but one poached egg was rock hard and one was soft. Asked a waitress for pepper but it never came. The food was delicious despite the above. The restaurant has a bizarre wait in Q to order which makes the entry very congested.  Had an almond latte which are hard to find in NZ and it was spot in.  Overall very good just missed on a couple of small things.

We decided to cool off with this cold and yummy sangria and tried some of their tapas which was also top notch. The waiter fluently spoke both English and Spanish, but I don’t think this is unusual here. We enjoyed our visit and would recommend. Happy hour is from 4-7 and is much cheaper than later in the day. It was still pricey, but worth it.

Brunch was probably forgettable and they were almost empty while other restaurants nearby were overflowing so perhaps they need to rethink the brunch offerings.

Restaurant business is a hospitality business and hospitality is what you get along with excellent service food and wine despite the house wine arriving cheesey carafes only surpassed by the purple glasses. My tip, don't cram into the sea side or beach, try the taverna side with the extra space, the view is just as good, and secondly don't miss the after dinner "" amuse bouche"" particularly if it's the chocolate mouse."

The only reason for one is for the ambiance - the decor is very nice, especially on the outside area. Outside of that, our service was abysmal. Not one time did our server ask how our food was, if we wanted another drink, if we would like to see a dessert menu, or if he could get us anything else. If he would have asked any of these questions we would have told him that the octopus appetizer we ordered was beyond bland. - no salt, no seasoning and the so called grilled octopus had no char and tasted like it had been sitting in muck for so long that the skin was slimy and fatty, like we were just chewing on gelatin - inedible. Our entree, which was just the simple burger, was fine, and that's all. Cooked perfectly, thankfully, but again not much to it. The frites that came as the side were hard as rocks from being over cooked. The wine, cab for me, Pinot for my husband were bitter and tart and we would have liked to have sent them back, but for the server never saying a word to us for the entire meal - he didn't even bring us our food or drinks. We cannot understand how this restaurant has any good reviews.

Delicious pate and salads for starters, Two of my friends had the lamb dish. It was cooked perfectly and was really flavorful. Nice vegetables on the side. Not a big portion of lamb, but just right when you are having another course or two. I would go back once a week for the linguini with shrimp and crab. Don't let the squid ink scare you off. My friend had the steak frites which was ridiculously tender and tasty.  Excellent waiter who gave us good advice on wine and even gave us an extra scoop of pistachio gelato to share. Reasonable prices. This was my favorite meal of the trip.

For that reason, I'm giving the restaurant 4 stars -- otherwise, everything was very good and I would recommend it.

The shop was beautifully decorated and festive. We went upstairs to the cafe so that we could order food not just treats. It is lovely with an open airy design. Service could be better, I noticed at least four tables being served water at the tmsame time as we were. We had to ask for water and it took at least 5 minute while the other tables had been seated before us. We ordered the Tokyo set which included fried chicken, salad, green tea latte and a matcha and passion fruit dessert. We also had a lobster roll and cronut (pineapple lemongrass). The chicken was well cooked and well seasoned in typically Japanese style it was chicken thighs, salad was fresh and lightly dressed but also only baby lettuces, the cronut was nice but I don’t get the obsession. Finally the matcha and passion fruit dessert was good, but the layer on top with ganach and white chocolate was too sweet, leave it off and it was perfect. All in all a good place to get a treat, but the cafe is over priced.

Which means it's crowded, noisy and semi-shabby. The tables are too close and the banquettes are extremely uncomfortable. Cold wind blows in from the door because there is no vestibule.  Food was good, not great. Good list of French wines.  We started with charcuterie and cheese plate. About on par with Boar's Head cold cuts and supermarket cheese-counter cheese. Nothing special, nothing especially French and pricey at $31.  I ordered the lamb. After 30 minutes of waiting, the waiter came back and said ""we're out of lamb."" Huh? After 30 minutes? Anyway, I ordered the cheeseburger which was made with short-rib meat and was tasty. But nothing French about it at all.  We then ordered dessert: Tarte tatin (apple pie of the south of France), classically served with vanilla ice cream. The waiter came back, this time after 15 minutes, and said they're out of vanilla ice cream. Again, Huh? He offered to serve it with chocolate ice cream. Well, both the pie and the ice cream were fine.  So... OK food but not special. Inept service. Unappealing, loud room. Expensive for what it is.  We won't be back.  The next day we went a fabulous Fench Bistro called Le Parisien in the East 30's. This is what Dominique should aspire to be."

I had spinach chat which was huge! Then the Goan fish curry was amazing. We had a rice and naan bread between us and couldn't even finish it all. Service was good and it had a lively atmosphere. Would definitely recommend for a good curry.

Due to a change of plans, we had to find a restaurant for my dad's birthday in NY on that night, after some research I booked a table online and was very happy to still get a table. The waiters were nice and attentive and gave us the time we needed to explain my non-english-speaking parents the menu. Then the waiter came with a plate with the different kinds of meat and they all just looked amazing. We took 2 x the filet steak and 2 x the Ribeye, we wanted to take side dishes per person, but the waiter advised us, to only go with two side dishes - which was a very good advise, because the steaks were quite big, we couldn't even finish the side dishes. And the meat - let me tell you - it was amazing! it was perfectly grilled, it was tender, juicy and so tasty! They also have a broad selection of wines, which vary in price ranges - we took a bottle of a Malbec for around 30USD I think, which was absolutely worth it. The evening was an outstanding experience, food and service wise. We ended up going to K Rico another time during our 5 days in New York and we would fly to New York again, just to eat the steaks!

"We were greeted and our coats were taken for us before showing us to our table. I keep going back and forth on my feelings about our dinner at Jungsik. On one hand the service was incredibly slow to start. Our greeting, drink order, and food order took a good amount of time. From the time we sat down to the time we left we were at Jungsik for 3 hours.  We decided to drink cocktails along with dinner and the cocktails were well crafted. For dinner we chose the Signature Tasting Menu. The meal started with an amuse bouche which represented Korean side dishes. These small bites were a beautiful start to dinner. We enjoyed a variety the flavors, textures, and scents.  Our 1st course was the OSETRA CAVIAR. The caviar was a good dish although not memorable. The 2nd dish was FOIE GRAS MANDOO (not dairy free so I decided to risk it with a lactaid pill). The Mandoo and the Japanese Wagyu were delicious but the star was the broth. The broth was scrumptious and satisfying. 3rd course was OCTOPUS. With it's perfect combination of crunchy exterior and tender inside this dish was outstanding. Our 4th dish was BLACK COD. Black Cod isn't usually my favorite but I found that this dish wasn't overly sweet so I enjoyed it. 5th dish was TUNA KIM BAP. This was probably the most inventive dish. The Kim Bap was rolled into a small cigar and was a wonderful taste and crunch. The 6th dish was GALBI. This dish confused me honestly. I still am not sure whether or not this was supposed to be served cold or not but it definitely was. I found it rather off putting and would have said something but there wasn't staff nearby. Next came OMIJA which means ""five flavors"", which are sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and pungency. Enjoyable. The 8th dish was the start of dessert. My husband was given a Baby Banana which was actually a small pastry. Unfortunately, it didn't wow him. He felt the focus was more on the presentation that actual flavor. I was given Pears along with Pear Sorbet.  As a person with a dairy allergy, there are two desserts which always disappoint me from a fine dining establishments; fruit or sorbets. Other restaurants with the same amount of notification have stepped up and presented pastries and/or composed dishes to me. In addition to this I have to ask, where was the Korean influence? I basically ended up with pears tossed with cinnamon and sugar. The 9th course was the ROASTED CHESTNUT. Greg was presented with a bowl of roasted chestnuts (for show) and a chestnut truffle to eat. Unfortunately, Greg felt it was truly lacking any chestnut flavor. I was given a different sorbet (not thrilled again). To end the meal we were given a small bowl of petit fours. Luckily these were a combination of sweet flavors and textures that saved the ending of our dinner.  We enjoyed most of dinner but in comparison to other like restaurants we agreed we wouldn't return."

We have started our night with dry greetings from the sommelier ""We do not serve Korean drinks here sir, this is more of a French restaurant rather than Korean and our food is delicate"". After tasting the seasonal menu I can confirm that it is bland not delicate. Tasteless, concept less, unimaginative food served in enormous portions. The big chunk of cod was murdered in a pepper sauce, the large layers of fat inside both pieces of lambs were probably there on purpose but definitely unappetising. Wine pairings with neither kicks nor soul. Mediocre deserts. Petit fours was only three. An unmemorable night you would want to forget, after digesting the amount in the credit card statement."

And I don't mean that as an insult -- I'm Korean and love Korean food. But I generally think of plentiful comfort food in a plainly decorated mom and pop restaurant, not haute cuisine. The service was accommodating and helpful. We were there for my husband's birthday, and they presented us with personalized menus that wished him a happy birthday.  We started with an amuse bouche/banchan that included steak tartare, fried oyster, foie gras, and raw fish wrapped in thinly sliced Korean radish. This was unlike any banchan I'd ever had! Although this could have been served at any fine French restaurant, the Korean flavors and influence really came through, especially with the fish. Although recommended that we have 5 dishes each off the regular menu (we opted not to do the tasting menu), we only ordered 3 each, which filled us up. We had the sea urchin for two, bossam (pork belly with dwenjang rice), gom tang (wagyu and pine mushroom soup), crispy red snapper, black cod, and dessert. They also brought another dish for my husband's birthday. If you're afraid of spicy Korean flavors, nothing here was too spicy (or spicy at all), but the Korean flavors were evident in all the dishes. It was really the perfect combination of Korean and French. I highly recommend it!

Some of the descriptions of the food, spices, and inspirations for the dishes were a little unfamiliar coming from a Korean influence, but the food definitely gives a sense of place. Each dish was flawless, although the Mackerel dish was a little too fishy for our taste. (Our mistake for never having had Mackerel before.) The Octopus was delicious; tender and perfect. The Bossam (pork belly rice) was beautifully porky without being greasy. The Sea Bream was delicate and flavorful. I would recommend the Galbi (pork ribs), but you can also have them on W 32nd probably just as good but not on such a pretty plate. The desserts were works of art that were as tasty as they were beautiful. The Jang Dok were little kimchi pots made of ganache which was a nice way for the chef to tell his story. Likewise for the Harubang, by far the prettiest plate. I wish there was a little bit more light so we could have enjoyed the beauty of these plates. Wine list is excellent. The service was spot-on and polished, although a little reserved. We were able to warm up our servers a little by asking some questions and they showed some personality.

After three nights of great eating in NYC (Nobu, Beauty & Essex and Baltazars), we wanted something a little more understated, less crowded and not so noisy...  As soon as we entered, I was signed in relief that I had made the effort to dress up and wear a nice jacket as would feel out of place without one. Although say that, didn't feel like it was stuffy or snobby in any way - just classy.  The tasting menu + accompanying wine seems to be the go-to choice, however we decided to choose our own appetiser, entree and main and am glad we did. I had the mushroom, steak tartare and halibut and all of them were excellent - and rich. My wife had the tuna, salmon salad and snapper and once again, excellent - but rich. Don't get me wrong, we love rich food but maybe the last three nights were catching up with us.  We had a beautiful riesling and couldn't have been happier and shared desert bing the potato tart - which was my least favourite dish. It was a little tasteless, but then, after three rich dishes, probably a good thing.  Service was excellent. Table space excellent. Prices were in line with fine dinning and not over the top. Great time. Would definitely go back and its reputation is well deserved.  See you next time...

The food presentation is outstanding. Each dish is a picture of balance and color. In the tasting menu of countless tiny courses...all of which combined could fit into a medium sandwich with lots of extra bread left over...costs something like $160 without wine or beverage. Some of the morsels are delicious and you can even swallow them like you would a vitamin pill. some of the morsels are very mediocre. Some are served with ""vegetables"" which consist of two edamame peas and two slices of carrot so thin you can see through them (smaller than a dime). For those of us who like Korean food, a Korean ""meal"", this is a travesty. To those of us who are pretentious or want the avant grade experience, it's OK. The bathrooms also have those really expensive digital toilets that blow hot water up your bum, followed by hot air, etc. In summary, rated poor because the food quality not worth the price."

We went here to celebrate my cousins anniversary and my birthday. I have no idea what I expected but this went so far beyong my expectations.  The resturant is small but beautiful. I don't think there is a bad location to be seated. Our water was awesome. He helped us navigate the wine list which was really a book the size of a novel. He narrowed it down to three for us and then we picked. It was great and went well with our menu.  Also, the menu came out personalized wishing us a happy anniversary and birthday! A small touch that goes a long way. At the end they gave them to us in a folder to take home.  We did the tasting menu. Which is quite deceptive. Each course is not only beautiful but sooooo good. The only course that I didn't absoultey love was the one with the poached egg, kim chee and pork belly. Each course was better than the next. What is deceptive is although the portions seem small you will be incredibly full long before you are done. Make sure to pace yourself. Because the steak course is so good that I was actually sad when I couldn't finish it! It was so tender you could cut it with a plastic fork!  The dessert course is actually three. All three were wonderful and nothing alike so worth having at least some of each.  One tip: We normally eat late. This was a long meal (over three hours). I would reccomend coming a little on the earlier side (5:30/6) since you will still be there quite a while for the tasting menu.  Bottom line: All four of us LOVED it.

Located in the Marriott Downtown hotel, Bills Burger is just the thing for a bar based meal. This is a typical restaurant / sports bar set up with lots of TVs showing sports channels.

The only downside I think is the service, which is patchy both in speed and attitude. Since I was (am) staying at the hotel, I have visited three times in the last week and the food has been consistently great, and the service consistently sub-par.

"Was visiting NYC on my birthday and wanted an authentic Italian restaurant dining experience. Traveling with my wife and 7 other friends so I didn't want to risk anything less than a top-notch eatery. Checked TA and searched restaurants in the area we were staying. IL PUNTO showed up at the top of the list. After reading many of the reviews, I decided to give it a try and made a reservation through OpenTable.  Was thoroughly impressed from the time I stepped inside. (Don't let the appearance of the exterior cause you any concern.) The place is small but well-managed. Several tables were full (7:00pm) and our reserved table was ready and waiting. The owner/manager greeted us and promptly seated us. From that point on, service was excellent. The menu (authentic Italian) was full of fantastic choices and made it difficult to pick an entrée. On the server's suggestion, I tried the cauliflower soup appetizer. It was exceptional. My main course, ravioli with lobster meat was a good choice, too.  Overall, the group enjoyed the meal with numerous complements on the food.  If you're in the Manhattan (Hell's Kitchen) area of NYC an want ""real"" Italian, stop at IL PUNTO for dinner (only open evenings). I don't think you'll be disappointed."

The wine pours were also nice and were brought to the table in small bottles that were filled to the brim and were then poured into the wineglass. I liked this because every glass was poured the same amount. The only downside was that the restaurant was really loud, making it difficult to talk to your dinner companions. Service was very attentive and all of the staff seemed to care about your dining experience. Dining there was not cheap, especially with drinks, but was a very nice evening.

We had dinner on a busy Thursday night in December. Our entrees were awesome; fresh grilled fish and with tasty veggies, cooked to perfection.  Despite the busy hour our meals were served promptly. Service is excellent. Il Punto is decorated in a festive holiday theme, which only adds to the charming atmosphere.  While there’s tons of good restaurants in the Theatre District, Il Punto is the equal to any of them and a good location close to Penn Station. Put it on your list !

We had an appetizer of the Caprese which was ok BUT needs more flavor....The absolute STAR of the meal was the mushroom risotto, it was OUT OF THIS WORLD amazing, seasoned wonderfully - portions HUGE - one of the best meals I have had in a long time!!

He had Cioppino, which was good; and the boys got Ziti with meat sauce and plain buttered noodles (I told you they were accommodating!); but it was my lobster raviolis with pink champagne sauce that stole the show. Excellent wine, excellent service, excellent food = very fine dining. (Or as the boys are telling me, very fancy!).

Nonetheless Simone was a wonderful host, service was excellent,aperitif drinks were nicely and generously prepared and desserts were very good as was the espresso.So all in all we will return and try hard not to compare it to the food we get served in Puglia....

Good place to go on a Sunday late afternoon for that pasta course followed by a nicely prepared chicken marsala and a glass of chianti Unfortunately, like a lot of these places, most of the produce, fish, meat is from non sustainable sources. But that's unfortunately endemic in the NYC restaurant scene. Vegetarians can get a good meal here, but vegans beware of hidden ingredients.

Everyone loved their selection...from Lobster Ravioli to their version of Lasagna, it was a perfect meal for a cold winter's night. It does get fairly crowded so reservations are highly recommended. And it is fairly intimate table seatings, so probably not the best choice for large groups.

YUM	"Last year we visited the area and ended up at another well known burger shack. Later that day we stumbled upon Bill's. It looked so appealing and smelled heavenly from the sidewalk. I made a mental note & planned on visiting on our next trip to NYC for the holidays. Fast forward 1 year and here we are at Bill's Bar & Burger!  Upon arrival, we walked inside and found the place pretty packed. We were asked IF we had made reservations and the answer was ""no"". So, we were expecting the worst. However, we were told to head on down the steps and meet the hostess at the bottom of the stairs to be seated. At the bottom, no one was waiting for us. So we approached the hostess stand and got in line there. We explained that we had been sent down from upstairs. After a few minutes we were seated at a HIGH top and given menus. I was a little concerned about the HIGH seats since we had 2 small children in our party, but there were no other seats available at the time. A waiter was around and said he would be with us shortly. We waited and waited and waited. Finally, we see the waiter ask someone else to wait on us. It seemed like chaos.  We ordered 2 burgers and a basket of the sweet potato waffle fries. We also ordered a kids hotdog, which is a foot long! It came with a side of regular french fries and a kids beverage for $10. A regular burger runs around $13 and does NOT come with any sides. Add bacon for an upcharge.  It took about 35 minutes from the time we walked through the door to the time our food was arriving at the table. Everything looked amazing. Burgers were plump, juicy and oh so flavorful. Delish! Bacon was amazing. Regular fries were very tasty, crispy on the outside yet fluffy on the inside. Sweet potato waffle fries were disappointing. They had great flavor but were thin and turned out oh so crunchy and crispy. We asked for a new basket that was not overcooked. Well, we ended up with a second batch of crunchy fries.  Overall, we had a really good meal at Bills Burger & Bar. The burgers were really good. The kids enjoyed the hot dog & so did we since we had to help eat the foot long dogs. Regular fries were good, although they are probably frozen and not fresh cut. Sweet potato waffle fries were a miss. Prices were a tad high, but we expect that in NYC near Rockefeller Center. Dining room area was OK. It felt cramped and I was NOT crazy about the high top tables (for kids or adults). Downstairs seating felt like a basement, where as the upstairs was little more airy with a bar-pub overtone. Restrooms were clean, but one of the toilets kept leaking water on the floor. Staff was friendly. Service is a tad on the SLOW side. So, do not go if in a hurry. I would recommend. I will be back, but next time I will make reservations in hopes of getting a booth or regular table instead.  Bottom Line: Excellent burgers. Well worth a visit if in the area. Would recommend and will most likely be back next Christmas!"

Stumbled upon Bill's and glad we did. It's not always easy to get seated as a group of 16 but Bill's is two floors with plenty of space and they seated us right away in the middle of lunch rush. By the time we left it was close to full so glad we showed up when we did. Most of us went the burger route. I had the chili which is thick and served with tortilla chips for dipping. Everyone enjoyed their meal, the prices were reasonable, and the service was friendly and made sure drinks stayed full.

Burgers were delicious and service was fast. We chose this place for reviews on their gluten free options (supposedly dedicated fryer and gluten free buns) my son has celiac and ate all of his kids cheese burger without complaint. My only issue was when we ordered milkshakes. The one was recommended by the waitress and I asked if it was mint or mint with cookies for the GF kid. She said it was just mint, we’ll when it came to the table (food runner) it had cookies as a garnish and cookies in the shake (think mint chocolate cookies and cream. I know. Yummy!). I was concerned and she said “I checked chef said it’s gluten free” so the kid ate a cookie and started annihilating the shake. About halfway into it our waitress comes back profusely apologizing and said wait. It’s not gluten free. I double checked and chef said “there might be some gluten in the cookies” so she checked the box for the cookies and they were definitely not GF. I don’t blame her, and was very happy she rechecked and questioned the kitchen and came back to us. I was upset at the cook or chef who should understand the difference between “a little bit of gluten in the cookies” and gluten free. When it’s a medical issue and a dietary restriction not due to a fad or a lifestyle choice it’s a serious matter. The kiddo got a replacement shake and we made it through the night without any major repercussions from the glutening. I do recommend this place still, my burger was A+ just be diligent if you have any dietary issues.

We feel compelled to leave a review for AKAR Restaurant in Ubud here. It’s quite new and I’m unsure if it’s overly mainstream, yet! It is hand-on-heart the best food I’ve ever tasted in my life. Packed with flavour.  We only found it by googling “best dinner in UBUD”  We tried so, so many places in Ubud, including Twist, Elys Kitchen, and many more — all amazing, by the way. However, we went to AKAR & our minds were blown. A notch above everywhere we’ve been at home and in Bali.  The atmosphere is unbeatable. The service is surreal, even for bali standards (already a high standard). The food - phenomenal.  The dark chocolate soufflé is out of this world, as is the warm brownies.  Ps: no, this is not “cheap & cheerful”, but it’s also not too far at the “fine dining” end of the spectrum either…. portions are good sized. It is truly a must.  Cocktails also unreal.  If you come to UBUD and don’t try this place, you’ve missed out (and Twist)  Finally - no, I’m not on commission ha ha. I am just on my honeymoon and had some of the best food ever & best service ever.  Special shout out to Kwai and Rian, our two servers they went completely above and beyond  Cheers!!

Whilst I can’t really offer total criticism of the meal, I found most of the dishes to be bland. The Lamb Rogan curry tasted as though it was made with gravy...not a curry. I’ve eaten in many Indian restaurants in the world and there have only been a few that I would not return to, this is now one of them. The service was good and I’m sorry I can’t offer any praise for the $150 meal for two, with a bottle of wine and a gin/tonic. A final positive the naan bread was good!  I would not recommend or return...unless you like bland Indian food.

It looks like the restaurant is under Michelin consideration and they need to step it up. Lovely decor and presentation, but the food somehow just doesn't live up to expectations. We have traveled to India and are frequent diners at the small places in Edison, NJ (little India) -- places where you get wow (but definitely NOT atmosphere cheap). Utsav is very convenient to theaters, and has a prix fixe menu. We did a combo of small plates, entrees and dessert. The small plates were both excellent -- traditional samosas and a quinoa potato patty. The mains less so. The menu has a combination of traditional and different, and my husband's Baingan Bharta (eggplant) was enjoyable. I had the Shrimp Goa, which was supposed to come in a coconut sauce. It was basically Shrimp Tikka Masala, and it was overcooked. I mean to the point of tough. I've had that issue in Indian places before, but that is a rookie mistake to be sure. Short on time I did not send it back, but also did not love it. The dessert was again quite good, a traditional kheer but with coconut sorbet in the middle. The entire meal cost $150 for 3 people (tax and tip included -- no alcohol). In Edison it's usually about $65 and we have tons left over. I highly doubt we will be back."

I tend to hold my authentic Indian dining experience against meals I've had in London. This place was delicious and as far as I can tell, the real deal. Went out as a group of friends, and we were truly the minority given the number of tables occupied by people obviously from India. So to me, that's always a sign of an authentic ethnic restaurant outside the actual country it is trying to represent.  As you enter the restaurant, there's a very small (6 person maybe) bar in a street level lobby. Then you go up a flight of stairs to the restaurant. The layout is spacious, open, and has windows at each end of the room which makes the space seem even larger.  The food was fantastic! The wait staff was the only reason I didn't give 5 dots. They were 'very good' too, but not always friendly (we had three different waiters). And although they have a liquor license, we weren't offered the wine list or drinks. We had to ask. Which may be cultural, I don't know. But it was a bit odd.  I will be back. And I will tell anyone I know who's traveling to the Times Square area who like Indian food to be sure to check this place out!

However the service was not great, e.g. we asked to order scallops and were simply told ""no"". Upon questioning we found out that they had no scallops. (thats just one example of the poor communication). We ordered several items that were not in stock. Despite that fact that there were only about 4 other tables occupied (at 7pm on a busy Sunday) it took almost an hour for food to be served. When the food eventually came it WAS very tasty, but several of the meals were cold or only luke warm at best. Overall high priced poorly served and poorly presented food that admittedly would have been a winner with better service and served hot and in a timely manner"

Food is also very gentle on the stomach and very well cooked. Top marks for the chef. The waiters need to be more humble in their approach and a smile and less seriousness definately will add more spice to this superb restaurent. Thank You for your ""home cooked meals ""."

We had assorted dishes, such as Paneek Paneer, Sea Bass and veggie dishes. We ordered Garlic Naan and Jasmine Rice, which were extra. The food was very tasty. The sea bass was very small for the high price charged, but it was also very tasty. Living in New Jersey we found the prices very high, but knowing that we were in NY, it was expected. The restaurant is nicely decorated and is located in a courtyard between 46th and 47th Streets. The bar is on the ground floor and the dining area on the second floor.

A traditional Indian ice cream for desert which was a bit strange at first but very nice. Would recommend for a nice Curry in NY, good central location as well, near Rockefeller Center.

As someone that loves authentic Indian food and who has been to India over 40 times, I was looking forward to eating at Utsav. From the check-in with the hostess (who was very abrasive and curt) to when we got to the table, the service was absolutely horrendous. Waited 20 min for our order to be taken. 45 min until our first course arrived. The samosas were very tasty indeed, the squash soup was tasteless and the colic cauliflower was surprisingly tasty (that from colleague who dislikes cauliflower). Main course: the briani was ok; the lamb ragon josh was not curried enough(I asked for very spicy); the naan was bad enough that a true blooded Indian would not have touched it. The masala was ok but not curried enough; the vindaloo was good (but that is coming from a Texan who is used to Mac n cheese).  After we finished the main course we waited 25 min for the waiter to take away the dishes (after we called over the hostess). Another 20 min to order desert.  Desert was very lackluster, vanilla ice cream.  Overall decent food with the worst possible service.

First we tried at Bombay masala. Since the ambeince of restaurant mentioned was very Indian we tried utsav. First time it was disappointing. Bhindi fry was ordered as one of the side dish. See photo. Yes, it is friieeed. We wanted the naan to be crispy, it was blackish crispy. May be first time problem? So we tried one more time. Even second time also disappointed. We ordered Aalu palak but were served with panner palak, though they admitted the mistake by compensating with a desert, we politely refused. This is my experience. My choice at Times Square will be Banares.

We booked to go here on a whim on Christmas Day. The restaurant is huge, it was busy but not full occupancy. Reassuringly we thought, it was extremely popular with the Indian community so we were anticipating an enjoyable dining experience. Unfortunately this was not the case. My chosen starter wasn't noted as being hot and spicy, but for my palate it was and it spoilt what could have been a nice starter. The portion size of the first course was huge, and could have warranted for being half the size. Our choice of mains, although different I thought tasted very much the same. The chicken was a little chewy and we just couldn't get excited about it. The service was also just ok, not very personal and not very engaging.  We've eaten all over the world on our travels, so I fully understand how Indian food can differ. But, let's just say, if we go back to NYC we'll be swerving Utsav.

As we approached the restaurant my lovely wife noted that it looked somewhat intimate and quaint. Apparently we thought the bar area was the restaurant, and were soon escorted up to the spacious dining room. We were seated at a window and offered menus. The service was great, but the food fell short of expectations, and was very pricey. Our neighbor makes samosas and shares them with the neighborhood, and we expected the same authenticity at Ustav. Unfortunately, the flavors and textures were not there. I ordered the butternut squash soup, which was delicious, but the chicken tikka masala did nothing for me, nor did the kulfi, which I found to be almost too frozen to cut into and more a savory dish than a dessert. The prices were quite high and we did not leave with a good taste in our mouths, literally and figuratively. Next time we will try one of the smaller (and hopefully less expensive) restaurants.

When you find an Indian Restaurant in New York where 90% of the clientele are from the Sub-Continent, you know that they must be doing it right. That was the case on a Saturday night when we visited. Don't expect gushing US style wait staff. The staff, from the greeter to the head waiter were the essence of Indian good manners and correct service. You could have been in the Taj Palace in Mumbai. Pleasant and respectful at all times. The menu is extensive with both traditional and unexpected dishes. We had the crab cakes and bhel puri as appetizers, and Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Xacutti as entrees. All were excellent. Accompanied by a mixed bread basket. The Kingfisher Lager was good too! At 9:30 new groups of diners were still arriving and the majority were either Indian or of Indian decent. That must be a recommendation. We were impressed and enjoyed the meal immensely.

When we had visited this restaurant, several years back, we were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance and quality of food. So when we arrived in NYC this 4th of July weekend, Utsav was the 1st restaurant that came to mind for Indian food. I made a reservation to make sure we had a place.  We arrived with a lot of anticipation, but were utterly disappointed, by the time we left.  The restaurant started us of on the wrong foot, by stacking up unclean plates. Every plate we picked up (from the stack of plates provided) had food particles stuck to the bottom. Either their dishwasher was spoilt, or whoever was washing the dishes, did a shoddy job. I had to pick through at least 10 plates (supposedly clean) before getting hold of a “somewhat clean plate”.  At the Appetizer counter, there was a man preparing chat. I asked him for a helping, and was told that they will bring it to our table. By the time we left, no one had bothered to get us the chat.  The food quality was well below average, and not commensurate of a restaurant charging over $20/person for the buffet. There were very few items, both for the vegetarian and the non-vegetarian palate. The food tasted like “production line” preparation. There were two desert dishes that were clearly below par.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Indian food. Utsav has clearly lost its edge.

Wow, so impressed with not just the food, service but the owner herself! My brother-in-law planned a surprise 50th birthday celebration for my sister and Maria Loi was just wonderful to setup a back area table and be in on the surprise. The appetizers were all top-notch! The grilled octopus was tender and delicious and who knew that their tomatoes in the village salad would be so fresh and tasty! All of their spreads were so yummy and also loved their grilled halloumi. Wine selections were excellent and all paired wonderfully with our meal. They accommodated us by doing more 'family-style' with the main courses so we all shared and sampled. The branzino was delicate and light, lamb shank with orzo was tender and rich, and the eggplant was so delicious, it tasted like high-end shepherd's pie! We all had a sampling of their desserts with a flour less chocolate cake which was surprisingly delicate and chocolatey at the same time; a walnut cake that was so moist with honey and I can honestly say that the baklava was the best I've had!

We got the meatballs and soppressata for appetizers. The meatballs were delicious and my gf said they were just as good as her grandmas homemade Sicilian meatballs and that's saying something! The pizza had olives and sausage on it. The crust was nice and thin, but if there's one complaint it would be the crust was a little burnt in spots. Other than that a delicious dinner!

This place smells so good as you walk by, that you just have to stop and have a bite. The restaurant is really, really small, seriously. If you have a part of 5 or more, like I did, be ready to wait for an hour or more, especially at dinner time. So keep that in mind. What I saw was a lot of take outs, which is something that I will do next time, instead of dining in and waiting forever. They just don't have the space, and they don't take reservations or call aheads. Other than that, the staff and hostess were great and friendly. The pizza is done right inside brick oven. I believe one pizza would feed two, but if you're really hungry, then just stick with one all for yourself. The price is decent, compared to other NYC restaurants.

Quiet and charming ambience, helpful and knowledgeable staff and amazing food made this an evening we will long remember. $70 prix fix dinner offers ample choices. The food is beautifully prepared and presented - starting with wonderful bread choices, an amazing mini- ravioli amuse bouche right to the incredible desserts we felt we were in a foodies' paradise. We are sure that anything we might have ordered would have been top notch but I have to mention the chicken liver ravioli, duck breast, diver scallops, apple tarte and chocolate dessert. Wines by the glass were excellent and the waiter guided us in making a choice. We look forward to returning for another sparkling NYC dining experience."

As a meat loving family we were all craving a good steak. I found this little treasure on Google Maps. It was close tonour hotel and looked pretty good. We arrived after a long day of holidaying and looked a fright. I had no idea it was more fine dining than just a steakhouse . It really didn't matter because the staff didn't judge us on our appearance. They were extremely attentive and shared jokes with us. We got the porter house steak for 4, 2 of the 4 of us are very big eaters, so it made sense to do it this way The other 2 got the fillet steak and the fish. We devoured the steak in record time as it was cooked perfectly, medium rare, just how we like it. The sides are separate, so you just get the steak and you pivk the sides. We had the German potatoes, mash and string beans. I can not thank the staff enough for making this a night to remember. If you are ever in New York you need to come here.

Chinese tea offered on arrival at the table but beer & wine are also available. It was quite buzzy atmosphere and very reasonably priced.

We shared everything. We were sad we couldn't eat more. I can't wait to go back. Bring cash because they do not accept credit cards. Not expensive. Food can compete with any Chinese restaurant in the city.

We went to SAC based on a number of reviews we'd read - including here on TripAdvisor. On arrival (we hadn't booked) we were asked to wait 20 minutes - and, standing outside in Chinatown we asked some departing American diners whether it was worth waiting. They assured us that it was.  They were right.  We ate the sizzling steak, which was tasty and succulent - not to mention sizzling. We had the house lobster which was quite pricey but again was worth the cost and effort of eating. the salt and pepper prawns were to die for and the Lo Mein (chicken) was pretty good - if not as spectacular as the other dishes.  The service was great - the food came unbelievably fast and the waiters were friendly and welcoming.  Heartily recommend this one.

There are tables on left and right and we were happy where we sat on the left. You get free tea which was very good. We had the Steamed Tiny Buns w/Crab & Pork (basically a soup dumpling), Steamed Pork Dumplings, Shanghai Fried Rice and Vegetable Pan-Fried Noodles. The dumplings, any kind, are the way to go! So, so good! The steamed tiny buns were fun to try to eat without breaking them before getting it to your mouth. Next time we'll get 4 or 5 kinds and split them. The fried rice and pan-fried noodles we both very good and filling; but the dumplings are much more exciting. Very reasonably priced and good service. Very tiny but clean bathroom in the back.

There are many Shanghai cuisine restaurants in China town and I can 100% guarantee that this is the best one by far. We found this restaurant on last Tue (by luck) and since then, we kept returning to this restaurant on the next 2 days before flying back to London on Friday. We just loved their foods! During our visits, we ordered many different types of foods like dumplings, chicken, pork, noodles, fish...etc. and they were all absolutely delicious! (please see my photos for your references) The foods were cooked to traditional Shanghai style and were faultless. I also noticed that most of the customers were local Chinese and it showed ""this restaurant is where the local goes"". The price was reasonable as well. We ordered about 5 - 6 dishes each time and it costed around $30-37 (including tea and soy bean milk) - which was cheaper than a number of restaurants in China Town. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try the real Shanghai cuisines. We really miss this place as we still haven't found a Shanghai restaurant as good as this one in London."

Great space with high ceilings and bar. Phenomenal food, service and atmosphere. Tailored the evening to fit with our party - delayed courses as we were having too much fun dancing to the band. Every course was a win not just from a taste but also visual perspective. Thanks so much for helping make the evening special for us all! We also ate here daily during our stay and didn’t have a bad meal. Excellent!

The entire staff were so nice, warm and helpful and they treated us like family.  Every dish we tried was cooked to perfection. The food was so delicious with good size portions and the prices were very reasonable for being at a resort.  The restaurant itself is designed beautifully with bamboo and has a very exotic atmosphere with an fresh air open concept. They have fire dancers perform every Thursday night and they have traditional Balinese musicians playing on Friday nights. Both shows are free for all guest and they were spectacular.  This is one restaurant everyone deserves to experience at least once when I’m Ubud.  I Comfortably & Highly Recommend! ❤️

The best time would be for a morning trip to the pool.  The staff are friendly and welcoming.  The restaurant has a 100K min spend. To sit by the pool on a lounger there is a 150K min spend.  The bathrooms are very clean and tidy.  The meals are reasonably priced and decent sizes.  The pool areas is relaxing and peaceful surrounded by nature, blue colours and the sound of birds / a waterfall.  I ordered a tuna steak on ciabatta. Unfortunately the ciabatta was about a day old & the tuna was very dry. Given the bread wasn’t fresh, it make me slightly concerned the fish might not be either. But nevertheless it was a good value meal for 82K. It also came with fries which was unexpected (the menu didn’t say this). Unfortunately the fries hadn’t been cooked long enough and were still that processed harder raw potato in the middle. The fries would be yummier with salt.  I ordered a fruit salad which had a great variety of fruit including banana, strawberries, rock melon, water melon, and delish tasty apple!! It came with yougert, (granola on the top to my surprise) and lime. The bailenese honey was nice and lime flavoured (not too sweet!). The fruit salad could be improved with more lime, dragon fruit included  It would be nice if the menu ultilised the cheaper local sourced ingredients more - ie. the salmon steak at 210K Could be switched to a seared tuna loin at an affordable price around 15K.  It would also be nice if diary free nut milks were available for the coffee.  I would also suggest lowering the price of the fresh young coconut (even at top beach clubs they don’t seem to reach the 50K mark).  I would also suggest the option of adding sides to the breakfasts - especially a side of avo.  The menu could cater better to vegetarians and vegans or healthy eaters by allowing “a make your own” with sides option.  Overall, really impressed with the local and great taste decor. Will be coming back and will recommend to others.  Thanks heaps for a lovely treat of a morning :)

The pool was an infinity hanging pool overlooking lush greenery and river that's just instagrammably perfect and serene-looking!  The food were great as well, me and my girlfriends had the Nasi Goreng Kampung and it tastes authentic!  This place was nice, quiet and serene. Just what we were looking for, for a nice lazy Sunday afternoon...lounging on sunbeds, soaking the sun while reading a good book and listen to the nicely picked beach lounge music blasted from the speakers, while casually taking a plunge in the pool on a hot day. The definition of laid back chill Bali vibe!  Will definitely visit this place again next time I get the chance to visit Canggu!

Both of us had 30 day aged steaks with 4 sides of vegetables and sauces plus a bottle of Yarra valley (Victorian) cab sav which complimented a sensationally rich meal. Expensive by Balinese standards but outstanding in every way. Outstanding kitchen, service, management, ambiance and set up. Service was top notch and dessert were large but first class as well. Overall an outstanding experience and a new experience for us after may visits to Bali. If you can afford at least $100AUD a head to get the best steak ever, it’s worth the effort. Highly recommend.

It's worth pointing out we are from the UK but live in the home of brunch - Dubai.  From my perspective the food was amazing expect the BBQ which was a bit average. My wife on the other hand is vegitarian and we were a bit disappointed with the vegitarian spread and the fact there was no veggie Christmas dinner option.  The desert room was lovely and when the froyo machine broke the staff got me some ice cream which was not on the menu.  That brings me to the staff. They were amazing, in particular Adi who was serving us.  Drinks were a limited selection but well served.  The only complaint I had (apart from being overpriced!!) was the heat. There was no AC and there were not enough static fans. Many people outside had their day ruined and those inside could not enjoy the band outside.

Their cocktails and mocktails were great. The service was first class. We both agreed that we would definitely return on our next trip to Bali.

The delicious warm bread, home-made butter, fabulous homemade healthy drinks were simply incredible... I could go on and on. What a treat to spend a long weekend in Ubud and treat ourselves to The Kelusa - we will definitely be back!!!

I was slightly nervous as to their survival but much to my relief, it was still there!  I went twice this time in three days, both times great service, great banter, great food - a proper breakfast with eggs, sausages, bacon and beans but you can have what you want.

The restaurant took the booking happily for 35 people. On the day of our booking the restaurant called to confirm the booking and amount of guests, this was fine. My partner called back to confirm we still needed seating fot 35 this is when the restaurant surprised us by stating we would have to buy 7 family platters, this surprised us. Their response was they were very busy and this is indeed the time to make money. This is appalled us how can someone do this 2 hours before our booking. The restaurant were unhelpful and customer service was not top of their priority it was money for so called 20 kitchen staff and the time of the year and being busy. So if they were not busy they would have happily honoured our reservation without an issue.  Thank you for spoiling my 6 year olds birthday and causing us a headache on New Years Eve in finding another venue.  I would not be coming back to this restaurant nor will my family members who have been going here for many years.  I would not recommend this restaurant for their customer service, if you want a spoilt event then this is the place for you.

We were staying nearby last weekend and on reading the reviews thought we would give this cafe a visit. We had breakfast on Saturday morning -both ordering the English breakfast and then returned again on Sunday morning when I swapped to the English Potato hash. Both mornings we received excellent friendly service from our witnessed but Nora also made a point of coming out of the kitchen and chatting to us and making sure everything was ok. T The food was freshly cooked, plentiful and so tasty with a great menu where anyone can get food to eat -there are Turkish and mediterranean choices, healthy, vegan and vegetarians options. On Saturday one table were requesting changes to their breakfast because they eat only halal meat and on Sunday a Jewish gentleman asked for his breakfast to be cooked in a particular way, nothing was too much trouble. Absolutely no faults to be found. I even used the loo upstairs on Sunday and it was immaculately clean. If we lived nearby it would become a local.

Situated in East London’s popular Petticoat Lane Market, on Wentworth Street and near the corner of Middlesex Street, the café is run by Turkish chef Ebru Puleri and her female Turkish friends. It’s a friendly, warm place, with comfortable seating, and popular with local workers, neighbours, market traders, students and visitors to London.

I’m not a particular lover of Indian food as I do not like spicy meals but this restaurant exceeds its self with a wide variety of choices to meet everyone’s palate. I started with an excellent prawn dish and then had the butter chicken curry both of which were superb and well worth a visit.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that is nearby I would add that the staff were extremely pleasant and very helpful. He will not be disappointed.

Plae was busy and buzzing, lots of staff to tend to your very need. I had the non-veg Thali which was amazing and my partner had the fish curry, which was also excellent. Food came quickly, was hot and tasty and the prices were reasonable. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this experience and would definitely go back again next time we're in Balham.

Easy to find and an unusual set up in that the main restaurant and kitchen is adjacent each other ie another smaller quieter dining room which is accessible by going next door by exiting the restaurant and going in another doorway. Staff very accommodating and offer quiet dining ( next door) or in the main dining area which has a long table down one side seating large groups of probably 20 or more. Lovely atmosphere, can get loud and busy - basically typically Taverna. Great choice of food which is worth the wait as it’s served piping hot, freshly cooked and the staff whilst attentive do not rush you through courses. It’s possibly a little tired decoration wise, maybe even a few stains on the wall paper and some torn edges but if your happy with rustic environments and top quality food and service then this is the place for you. Good to see good choice of GF food and we overheard several times presumably the owner say to people “forget about the menu tell me what you like, or don’t like and I will sort it for you - I want you all to be happy’ Amazing - how many times do you hear that in a restaurant! It was a first time visit, definitely a place we would search out again should we return to Camden

The food is just lovely. We had the combined platter for two: the starters (tzatziki, hummus and taramosalata) were served with warm soft bread (and we asked for more!); the meat was tender, tasty and perfectly cooked; the Greek salad was fresh and nicely seasoned. We left feeling a sense of having had a healthy dinner, great value for money and, as Italians, we recognized the full flavour of the Mediterranean! We will be back soon!

We finally made it on New Year's Eve and it was definitely worth the wait! We've visited Greece many times and this place is as good as anything we've experienced over there.  The decor is very simple and really feels like a typical taverna. We stuck to the basic dishes - hummus and tzatziki to start, and then Kleftiko and calves liver. Everything was truly delicious and excellent. Even the bread! The wine also was lovely. Service was great and the prices very reasonable for London.  We'll definitely be back. Highly recommended.

Where was my ketchup?!	We booked this place based on its top reviews. So good, that it's the highest rated mezze in London. We visited ok an early Saturday evening. The restaurant decor is simple yet transformational. The themed Greek music complimented this perfectly. Staff were friendly and seated us quickly. We opted for four sharing starters between the three of us: houmous, calamari, feta & spinach pastry and halloumi. We received free bread with these too. The pastries were delicious! The calamari was top quality, although would have benefitted from a tartare dip. The houmous and halloumi were ok. For mains, my partner and his mum had lamb, which they insisted was some of the best that they had ever tasted. I had chicken souvlaki, which was full of flavour. We received a big bowl of salad to share between us. There was plenty, although some more feta would have been great. We also shared some chips and rice between us. The chips were seasoned to perfection, but desperately required some sauce. I asked for ketchup on two occasions but unfortunately never received any. At the end, we asked for the bill twice, and eventually we received it, followed by some free shots. Overall, the experience was great. I recommend a visit if you are nearby. Next time though, please provide the condiments guys! :)

Visiting London from Devon for football on Saturday, my son and I visited this wonderful restaurant last Friday having discovered it whiist googling ‘good restaurants in Camden’ and we were not disappointed.  Having had numerous holidays to our Greek Islands cancelled we we were craving good Greek food and hospitality, Andy’s Taverna ticks all the boxes.  The staff were fabulous they can’t do enough for you having first confirmed my email for the booking, Georgina greeted us. The restaurant is in 2 sections the first very full but we were given a quiet table in the corner next door, it even had Greek music playing on the TV.  The Mythos beer went down so quickly we had to order 2 more however the jewel of this whole place is the food.  Two types of Dolmades, one vegetarian one meet plus a plate of Calimari arrived, fresh and delicious with bread. Then the main was Andy’s mixed Souvlaki (we forgot to order fried potato but within minutes the waiter had delivered them no problem) and I had probably the best Moussaka I have ever tasted absolutely delicious just like being in Greece! Every main course is served with a bottomless Greek salad but we could only manage one!  There’s was simply no room for dessert which was a pity but we will definitely return this was an amazing experience thank you everyone at Andy’s Taverna Camden.

It is on a corner of a backstreet and easily missed. There are a few tables on the pavement but a view you will not have! It is a typical family run taverna as you would find in Greece. Simply furnished with a friendly owner and (I assume) partner plus a menu with all your favourites. Stuffed dolmades were a great starter and highly recommended. The prawn cocktail was served in large quantities with crisp and fresh salad. Sea bass on the bone was amazing as were the calamari being succulent and tender. We had rose wine by the glass but there is a wine list with Greek and European wines. As usual there was complimentary liquor after the meal as well as coffee. This is a place where the locals come and sit as well as those from further afield. Service of food was fast although when the restaurant filled up there was a delay for the bill. This is because there are problems finding staff due to Covid, Brexit and furlough and no doubt will be addressed. We will certainly return although I don't know whether they dance on tables in the evening. The bill for 2 was around £50 including service.

Such a warm welcome by all the staff - as if we were family! Not familiar with Greek wines we asked Andy for a recommendation, he went to gather a few bottles from the bar and insisted on giving us a wine tasting session until we found a bottle we liked. We picked a lovely med-dry white. The food was fantastic, so tasty and fresh. Halloumi and king prawn starters followed by mixed kebab mains, fries and a Greek salad. We left so full! I'd definitely recommend Andy's to anyone visiting London/Camden for excellently priced tasty food, considering it's central London!

Restaurant is well spaced out inside, so plenty of space between tables, hand sanitiser on the wall upon entry, very clean, staff wear masks while serving and nearly all customers observed the mask wearing while moving between tables or using the toilets.  Two of us ordered the Meze and the other two ordered the set Mixed Grill option with the three dish cold starters and between the four of us we shared all dishes. The food was very fresh and tasty, one of the better Mezes that I have had in a Greek restaurant, not overwhelming in size and very good value. The Meze had the added bonus of Kleftico (a speciality dish - the lamb melted in your mouth), which is usually not the norm but a very pleasant addition.  Service in the most part was very good, we only had a little issue with the young waitress in that she did not give us a tap water when ordered and when asked for it, again it did not materialise until we asked one of the male waiters and then they immediately got it for us. Not sure if the young waitress could understand us, but this happened again when requesting more bread and the bill, she just went outside to serve someone else, but eventually both materialised. Other than that small issue the service was perfect. When the bill came the (owner I believe) gave us a complimentary shot of Amaretto each, which was a nice touch.  Will definitely be returning and would highly recommend this restaurant for a lovely meal out.

And to make it even better, the price and the fact it is BYOB with no corkage, is unbelievable.  We couldn’t eat everything and so we were sent home with it as leftovers.

My friend surprised me with a visit here for my birthday, me a vegetarian and her very much a carnivore. The food is incredible! So many amazing flavours and the chef has clearly put a lot of thought into how the dishes all go together.  Not only is it delicious, but it is greatvalue for money. £20pp gets you the grande selection - a tapas-style offering of nearly everything on the menu. It's more food than we could eat (and boy did we try!). Favourite dishes included the cashew cheeze, the homemade pakoras and the two curry dishes.  You get free top ups of any dish you want (we couldn't manage that) and they give you doggy bags to take away your left overs. The vegan brownie we had for dessert was TO DIE FOR. Oh how can it be so rich and crispy and gooey all at once, and accompanied by delicious vegan ice cream.  You bring your own booze but we also tried the delicious complimentary tea at the end. They were also kind enough to give us little pots of the tea mix to try at home!  The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, with everyone cooing when their selections arrived, and the staff were incredibly lovely and helpful.  This is a gem in Earlsfield and I'll definitely be back, bringing friends (veggies and non-veggies alike) so that we can feast again!!

The food choices are a step up from those early days (reflecting the owner’s increased staff resources from the early days when it was just him + 1).

We just don’t want it to change. The owner is so grounded I hope that won’t be the case and he deserves every success. We visited yet again last Friday and tried the new £20 buffet menu. The tofish we usually love wasn’t available but the owner gave us the most delicious plate of noodles to compensate. The new dishes of guacamole, gazpachio, cashew ‘cheese’ and mung beans did not disappoint. In fact I think this was the best meal we’ve ever had there. Warm welcomes, lovely service, superb food with sublime flavours... but sssssh... don’t want anyone else to discover it!!!! Sadly, too late!!!

We were hoping to sample the 'tofish' but it wasn't on as the restaurant is experimenting with a new version. We were given a preview and was it superb - YES. Everything about Amrutha Lounge deserves accolades. We loved our evening there and will return fairly soon to experience great food, superb service, amazing value for money and an all round great time.

Great choice of jams. My fav was the rose petal. We didnt feel hurried at all. There was live piano playing in the back around. We got to take home our left over cakes. They were packed up so well in little plastic containers, Other places should copy this as it meant our cakes got home safe and sound. We look forward to our next visit thank you.

We had only experienced them for afternoon tea before, so perusing their ""all day dining"" menu was a little different.  They have a good selection of salads and sandwiches, which can be augmented with a good selection of wines and champagnes.  Food is a subset of that on offer from the JW Steakhouse (also in the hotel), but served in the opulent style of the Park Room.  If you're looking for something slightly less than afternoon tea, this is an option. (Although afternoon tea at the Park Room is also excellent.)"

Despite London having moved into the new Tier 2 (High) Covid-19 category, my wife and myself had Afternoon Tea earlier today in the Park Room at the Grosvenor House Hotel on Park Lane.  We arrived a little late but were given a warm welcome by both Andre and Herlyn who were not only expecting us (current bookings are understandably much lower than normal) but provided exceptional service throughout our visit. With only one other table taken, we were soon sitting at one of the nice window tables overlooking Hyde Park.  After taking our Tea (we both opted for English Breakfast) and Jam (Ginger & Rhubarb, Rose Petal and Strawberry) orders, it wasn’t long before our substantial Afternoon Tea (good range of delicious sandwiches, 4 lovely scones and some nice deserts) arrived. There was certainly plenty to eat and what was left was put into a doggy bag together with 2 slices of lemon drizzle cake.  Not only that, we had two pots of Ginger & Lemon Tea before departing by which time it was pleasing to see several other tables having been taken.  All in all, it was a most enjoyable experience - enhanced by both Andre & Herlyn who certainly went the extra mile as far as we were concerned!

They were in London for a game, and were using the JW Marriott as their base of operations. I then have returned several more times, and been impressed each time. In December, we were back to London, and on a totally leisure trip. We were staying just down Park Lane from the JW Marriott, and my wife asked if we could go to The Park Room for drinks. Well, that was a no-brainer - wines with my wife, with no meetings looming over her head, in a lovely space, just blocks from us. Off we went.  Now, there are three areas of The Park Room, and two are mostly attached, plus a lounge area, just around the corner, with a grand piano, which is more open to the reception area of the lobby. We were seated in the lounge area, near the piano, and I had the wine list in hand quickly. On this afternoon, the pianist was playing, and I think that this is only the second time, when he has been there - quite, quite good! Though the main dining room is gorgeous, one of the things that I like about the lounge area is that it has more of an open view of the attractive lobby - though no views out onto Park Lane, as that main dining area has.  We did the Henri de Villamont Clos Du Cromin Meursault ‘13, the Guillaume Vrignaud Fourchaume Chablis 1er Cru ‘15, and the Spelt “La Valentina” Montepulciano D’Abruzzo Riserva DOC ‘14. The wine service was great, but while the stemware was attractive (those are Park Room “signature glasses”), I was not that big a fan of the open bowl design - lovely to look at, but not my favorite for wines.  It’s now a tossup, whether I like the main dining room, or this little lounge area the better, but that might depend on whether the pianist is playing. We will be returning, as we have since making this discovery, a few years back.  Though this September visit was our first stay at the JW Marriott Grosvenor House Park Lane Mayfair/London, I had visited The Park Room twice before, once solo, and once with a friend, but this was the very first visit for my wife.  We had arrived from the States a bit too early to check into our room, in the hotel - but this was no surprise, as we had to take a flight out of LAX, rather than SFO, so knew we would be at least an hour - or two - early. That was not to be helped. We did the formalities, and told the reservations agent that we would just find some Champagne in the Park Room.  On this early Spring afternoon, it was as lovely, as I remembered it to be, with sunlight streaming through the windows, overlooking Park Lane, and Hyde Park. This is an elegant room, there is no denying, but it is also a very comfortable room, at least it was for us.  We were seated by the welcoming hostess, at a nice little 2-top, in the main dining area. While not against the windows, we still had a lovely view. From my previous experience, I believe that the dining area, at those windows, is most often used for Afternoon Tea, as it has much more of a salon feel, and look to it. We were in the main dining area, just behind that salon.  We had the wine list in hand, and settled in to relax, enjoy ourselves, and await our room assignment - knowing that we probably had at least an hour, or more.  We started with Perrier-Jouët Blanc de Blanc, and a glass of the Perrier-Jouët Blason Rosé. Both were served in lovely flutes.  We sipped, and relaxed, as we had been flying for quite some time, and when the Champagne was gone, moved on to Soellner Grüner Veltliner Fumburg ‘16 (a new wine to me), and the Henri de Villamont Meursault ‘15 (also a new producer - we were having fun now).  About half of the way through the still whites, our reservations agent arrived, and offered to show us to our suite, as soon as we had finished the wine. She made certain to give our server the room number, for the charges, which was a nice touch, as we did not need to bother with a credit card.  The afternoon had almost slipped by, and the wait was of no issue. We were in a lovely room, watching Hyde Park across the way, with excellent, and very friendly and attentive service, plus getting to explore some new wines. What a great way to start a holiday. I am so glad that my wife finally got to experience The Park Room, and now it was time to unpack, shower, and head back down to the lobby for dinner - with even more wine!

I recall at weekend lunchtimes a buffet menu was available. But as we were the only diners this Saturday lunchtime I can understand why this is not currently an option. The sole waiter seemed surprised to see us and when pointing out no alcohol was served (you must bring your own bottle) was perhaps hoping we would leave. A chicken makhani was rather flooded in sauce. I chose a non-vegetarian thali and perhaps should not have been surprised that it contained no fewer than three meat dishes, a slightly cold chicken tikka, a chicken makhani and a lamb rogan gosh. These came with rice, fresh crispy Nan and a delightful raita with pomegranates on top. Perhaps at least one vegetable or dal would have been preferable to one of the meat dishes.

We were visiting London for the weekend and wanted to have Lebanese. There aren’t any good Lebanese where we live. We had mixed trio of hummous. The best one was the beetroot one.  For mains we got Kafta Kashkash. We went weren’t sure what to expect. It was kebabs with a spicy tomato, onion sauce. I liked it as it make the kebabs easier to eat with the rice. It’s as a good meal. I should have forgone the starters and it was lovely.  The dessert wasn’t great. Over powered with rose water. We wrongly thought it would be similar to the Mahalabia in a Lebanese restaurant in Marrakech. That’s as divine and made with Orange water. So much nicer.  I recommend this restaurant. It’s easier to find from Chanery lane tube station rather than Holborn. We would have taken a taxi but there was queue and we would have been late.

So I was delighted when a friend suggested that a group of us should go to Chamisse this week. It is a very good restaurant, most of the team are Lebanese and the welcome is warm.  The setting is very simple, which is fine: the focus is always on the food. We chose to have a selection of mezzo and a selection of grills placed down the table so that the group of 20 could chat and eat contentedly without making choices. This is where Lebanese food it as its best, being shared by everybody with a little bit of this and more of that up and down the table. Small dishes flowed in (kebbeh, kellaj, fatayr, hummus, mfassack, tabbouleh, fattoush, loubieh bel zeit, labneh, moutabbel and more besides) and all tasted very good. My only comment was that some of the flavours were slightly blander than I like but they were very good. In particular the kebbeh was as good as I have tasted (deliciously moist in the middle and crunchy on the outside) and the labneh was wonderfully subtle. So definitely 4 plus for the food.  Very good service too. The team were there to look after us very well throughout, making sure the dishes moved along, that glasses were full and that everyone was enjoying themselves. Not intrusive but we did benefit from their attention throughout.  What more can I say - I look forward to returning.

I don't care who the chef is, or at least whose name is over the door, you simply never ever get any sense of passion, love or caring in the cooking of the food in an inernational hotel. When will we ever learn. This is a restaurant for those with a bucket list to tick off not a true love of food. It was nice enough but formulaic and 'mass produced'. God, the chefs must get bored of cooking Theos 'famous' dishes. We were guests of some friends so just let the evening unfold without any fuss but let me tell you, by the time the waiting staff have finished enthusing about their favourite dishes (the ones they have been told to push) there may as well not be a menu. The pace at which the waitrons poured the relatively expensive wine was outrageous. This was not great service this was rushed. Finally the restaurant is nondescript in the extreme, basically in the basement, and could be anywhere in the world.

"I went to this place for dinner on my birthday with my partner. Excellent environment, friendly, helpful and competent staff. We start with an aperitif and a couple of ""cicchetti"", the menu offers both a choice of tasting and an a la carte menu, we decided to order a la carte, tuna tartare (exquisite), cappelletti of veal and pappardelle with beef sauce (braised), both dishes fantastic to remember the Italian cuisine of the best traditions. Faraona ripiena, delicious, crispy on the surface with a melting filling. I believe that the quality of the dishes shows the competence and love of Theo Randall for the raw materials, the ingredients and the care and passion he puts into the preparations together with his excellent team. The dessert, ricotta cheesecake, was also very good, with a welcome addition of good wishes for me. Excellent wine list from which we chose a Nebbiolo delle Langhe by Ascheri 2019, very good. I had a perfect evening from all points of view. Thanks to Theo and his team!"

The restaurant features a regional menu which at £50 including wine is excellent value for money - tonight's was from Emilia Romagna but our prefernce was from the wider A la Carte which is priced by the dish.  Starters of Minestrone and a Cheese souffle were both filling and delicious and mains of Pappardelle and Sea Bream very enjoyable. We finished with a shared Italian cheese course followed by a lovely soft chocolate cake.  The wine list is a lovely tour of Italian regions but there is a nice choice of wines by the glass enabling us to try a selection, the Jermann Pinot Grigio and Planeta Chardonnay both superb examples.  Service was friendly and efficient and we were much more impressed than on our previous visit.

It was my daughter's 21st birthday celebrations, and I have always wanted to go to Theo's restaurant as I am a huge fan of his and Saturday Kitchen on BBC1 so always enjoy his appearances on the show. The restaurant knew it was my daughters birthday as I had informed them, but we were not expecting the fuss that was made of us. We were put on one of the chef's tables (Matt Tebutt and his wife had the other which just made my night) and Theo greeted us, wished Lily a happy birthday. He had time for everyone in the restaurant, guests were in and out of the kitchen all evening. The waitress we had was just fabulous and we had an absolutely superb evening, one we will be talking about for years to come. We had the Sicily taster menu, 5 courses with wines that accompany the courses. every course was sublime. And at £50 a head, thoroughly affordable for the West End of London. Cannot wait to return, already planning my next visit. And I know I keep thanking him, but thank you Theo, and thank you to all the staff. You really have a great team

Background: although our previous visit was marred by a menu/billing mix up the food was clearly very good so I wanted to return to experience it to the full and with that in mind I contacted the restaurant to give them my direct feedback. Pawel acknowledged my complaint and was genuinely apologetic and confirmed that he would make amends on our next visit. As it happens I'm not in London that frequently but circumstances necessitated that I was there a few weeks later and therefore made a much anticipated booking.  In a nutshell, it was a top notch experience -Katie our waitress looked after us like we were VIP guests and it was nice to meet Pawel who gave us a warm welcome and also saw us to our table and last but not least Vanessa the Manageress who came over to say ""hello"". Vanessa was very personable and it was really enjoyable to chat with her.  The whole meal was excellent, my favourite is the slow cooked beef ragu in Chianti -a must try dish!  Sadly I have no immediate plans to return to London but Theo Randall will be on my to do list when I am next in town....."

I am certainly Italian in my love of food! Dinner begins with focaccia, cherry tomato bruschetta brought unbidden to the table @Theo.Randall @icparklane. The cocktails are rife with strong Italian alcohols like Campari and vermouth, typical cocktails are Negronis and Old Fashioned. We tried both and they are well-fitting with the restaurant. It is impossible to choose one from Primi pasta dishes without regret that you have therefore missed another. When it’s pasta time, go for Taglierini con Gamberetti e Carciofi – a rich, overwhelmingly savoury mix of the freshest pasta with brown shrimps and artichokes. I usually don’t do this but we left our wine choices to the clued-up sommelier who really knew his stuff. In a tastefully decorated open-plan dining room that has plenty of space between the tables, he and his team offer a wide-ranging Italian menu with something for even the trickiest of eaters. Superb evening... flawless service and impeccable attention to detail. Yet another memorable night!

I was checking out various venues and as it was going to be an early evening meeting I spotted that there was an excellent set menu offering at Theos so I immediately made an online booking to secure a table as it was for a Saturday -success, however, heads up, there's a booking system glitch!  On the evening there was confusion with the staff regarding the menu, initially we were given a la carte menus despite the booking stating it was for the set menu.  In the end is was sorted, to a degree, as we were presented with a set menu option, but, not the one I had booked which included half a bottle of wine per person, apparently that one was not recognised and ours only included a glass of prosecco each! I decided not to make a fuss but clearly I was not happy especially for this mix up to happen in such a reputable hotel/restaurant*  Upon returning home I contacted the restaurant and Pawel was very apologetic and acknowledged that there was a glitch on the booking system and that he would make amends for our next visit......  Anyway, back to to the food -it was all very good and the staff were attentive but needless to say the experience was tempered due to the menu saga along with having to pay an extra £40 (unnecessarily) for wine so I shall reserve final judgement and do a more detailed report when we have our return visit.  *I first frequented the London Intercon about 40 years ago.

Still strongly recommend, but check carefully the various booking arrangements.

Even though we had to share main course and dessert the quantity is actually more than enough - we left quite full.  Whilst my friend had the bottomless Prosecco, I took the Apero Spritz which is divine. The only thing is that you needed to keep asking for a top-up.  We were served by the most friendly, jovial and polite waiter George, who looked after us very well. There was no request too much for George and he always served us with a beautiful smile.

We had booked for the Sunday brunch. Our group included small children but this was no problem. It took a little time for our free flow Prosecco to start and we were told that this was available for 90 minutes. About 20 minutes before that time was up we had empty glasses and because the restaurant had become busier but not full we seemed to be forgotten about, then suddenly we got our last glass! The buffet food with cold meats, cheeses and smoked salmon, eel and seafood was a good choice. You choose a main course which had two vegetarian options, fish and meat. Unfortunately one of our guests had been misheard and was served fish which he doesn't like! He had to have his main course of soufflé separately but everyone was apologetic. There was a pasta station but it was rather confusing as to what you did there to get any pasta cooked! Mains were nice and tasty and we were served some desserts but no plates and cutlery for ten minutes! Overall food is good but service a little disappointing. Restaurant itself is OK but no windows so all artificial light.

You could never accuse this venue of being cozy or intimate, it's too spacious for that but it's a very pleasant dining environment nevertheless. Our last visit had been on a Saturday night in May when we had been surprised at how many empty tables there were. This occasion a Monday night in November the reverse was true with most tables occupied, even early in the evening. Our service from Roald was excellent and we hope that he remembers his promise to ensure that we can have zucchini flowers stuffed with mozzarella on our next visit in January! Our food [ starters Italian cold meat platter and Burrata followed by lamb rack and lobster pasta] were very good although considering the price, I felt that bearing in mind the usual generosity of portions in this restaurant the lobster on my pasta was a bit thin on the ground. We look forward to returning once again at the end of January next year.

We were on holiday in England, and did not try the branch off Marylebone High Street, run by the same Bangladeshi family. Strongly recommended.

We ordered for four and there wasn’t a thing left by the end - everyone was very full and very happy!

We enjoyed our final meal of the holiday here at Rajdoot and were a little apprehensive as all meals so far over the weekend had been very good. I suppose we were just thinking that law of averages would mean at least one poor meal? How wrong we were as we enjoyed probably the best evening of our family break. From the moment we exited the taxi outside the staff were out to greet us, very friendly and made us all feel welcome. You can tell that they all care about their business as they couldn’t do enough for us and even offered us complimentary drinks at the end of the meal. There were all the traditional offerings and some nice specialities too. We had Jalfrezi , chicken saag, and a king prawn korma and I liked the option to have your chicken grilled / tandoori as a opposed to plain. Of course we had poppodums and chutney to start, who doesn’t? All washed down with ice cold Cobra beer. I think everyone was slightly jealous of my wife’s Chicken Saag, not only was it delicious but it came in the hit sizzling pot, which I always feels adds to the experience and I’d encourage them to serve the jalfrezi this way! I’m not sure if this is practical but it certainly makes the table go “ooooh” as the sizzling dish approaches. I also liked the fact that when I asked fir my naan bread well done it came nice and crispy just as ordered. Seating was covid friendly and waiters wore face masks so no issues with hygiene/ CV19 To finish off our fabulous evening the waiter allowed my son in law to take away his beautiful cobra glass that he’d been eyeing all evening, which I felt was a lovely touch and made Toms night! Thanks to all the staff at the Rajdoot and I would encourage you to try this place whilst in London. Highly recommended

I scoured through a lot of Indian restaurant reviews, recommendations etc online and finally settled on the Rajdoot. It was slightly out of the immediate area we were staying and despite a large selection of restaurants available that were closer to us, I took a chance and I'm so glad we did!  Upon arrival, the staff were very welcoming and friendly and continued to be throughout the duration of the evening.  The menu has a great selection of classic dishes and curries along with an ample choice of house specials. Both of us unable to choose, we asked the staff for recommendations and they sure did not let us down! Exceptional curries!  We were served the King Prawn Nobabi and the Bahari Lamb (would highly recommend both dishes). The lamb was incredibly tender and melt in the mouth and the sauces for both dishes were explosive in flavour and fragrant in aroma. We asked for our dishes to be made on the hotter side of the spice scale and they got it spot on.  The dishes are all freshly made to order and you can certainly taste that. Fresh, flavoursome and perfectly spiced to our liking. What more could you ask for?  The service throughout was efficient and non intrusive and we would not hesitate to come back here again next time we're even remotely close to the area.  The final bill was more than reasonable for what we had and we were even presented with a small digestif on the house, thank you!  Our meal was the highlight of our weekend and a perfect first night out since lockdown.  I hope more people get to try this little gem as they won't be disappointed.  Until next time.

The carpets on the way in were a bit dirty, the tables are a few flights of stairs downstairs (not good for the less mobile) and the whole restaurant just felt tired and in need of some TLC.  The chef was very accommodating with some of our table guests and the food was cooked ok, but we rushed a bit because we just couldn’t get into the “theatre” of it and the food was just ok.  We’ve visited the NY restaurant and loved that. Not sure why today’s visit fell short but we’ve both ended up with a dodgy tummy so unlikely we’ll be coming back.  Bit of a shame, really.

I would imagine you would always need to book. Went to the Piccadilly restaurant in the past for a business lunch and enjoyed the spectacle so took wife and 14 year old son. If you don't like sharing you will need to book for 6-8 people I believe as there are 8 seats at each grill. There are quite a few grills close together, so it gets quite noisy. As long as you expect that it isn't an issue. Our fellow diners were fine, but I can imagine that wouldn't always be the case.... We had some sushi, wagyu, chateaubriand, scallops and lobster tail along with various vegetables with some rice. All of which were excellent and, needless to say, served piping hot. The chef cooks this all in front of you on the hot plate and does a little show with the various ingredients - onions become a chimney, spells out words with the rice, etc., Service was attentive and the staff were very pleasant. Not cheap, but well worth it as a treat. We will return.

We weren’t allowed to sit and enjoy a drink however as we were rushed off to our table with a warning about how soon we would have to vacate the table. Not exactly welcoming  Eventually a waitress came and took a drinks order and gave us menus.  Long wait then she came and took our orders and a while later we finally got a drink. In the us where they live on tips this would never have happened  The chef was Spanish and very difficult to understand. In fact the other three in my party had to ask me what he was saying.  The display was almost non existent. Other benihanas have always put on a real show with food being flicked around, a few ingredients and utensils in the air etc  As for the food each part of the food was served individually so apart from the soup it was all pretty cold  A few selected comments  The fish was tasteless The chicken was dry The prawns were tasteless The rice was tasteless. This was REALLY surprising as we have always rated benihanas as having the best fried rice anywhere.  I’ve never seen egg fried rice cooked this way before. First cook the egg into a well cooked omelette making sure it’s tough. The add the rice. Everywhere else the egg is used to bind the rice  I would have asked for the 12.5% service charge to be replaced by a -12.5% lack of service charge but did not want to make a fuss as the staff seemed distant and just doing their job rather than making an effort to provide a high quality experience for their guests  Hopefully you will find this honest feedback useful in improving your uk offering

We have booked a table for the family of four. We were late more than 15 min and waited approx 10 mins in the lounge, so not too bad (the restaurant offers 15 min grace period). I won't be much mistaken if i say that from the time of our taking order to the moment the chief came up to our table, an hour has passed. We had starters, but these finished quickly. The chief was lovely, doing his job the best he could. Food was a ok, but i don't think worth the money. As my 12 years old son said: 'yes it was entertaining but there were other places that could fill your stomach much better'. As a food lover i am not satisfied. Are the 3 skinny slices of salmon and thimble of steamed rice worth £30 considering the fact they taste exactly like you would have prepared it yourself at home ? Not sure. Nothing spectacular about grilled chicken or the sea food either. So, Benihana is fair enough as a one off entertaining only experience, because without the food being cooked in front of you it does not have anything extraordinary to offer. And 16% service charge at the top of it ?? All the best to our lovely cook Diego.

We had been put into a private room away from the main area - which we were glad about as it was extremely loud in the main restaurant. The cocktails list is poor - most sound fairly unappetising and the only few we tried were not great & we wouldn't have ordered a 2nd. One had an ice cube in which was the size of the glass so was an utter rip off for what you receive. Once at the table, we asked for the wine list which was apparently non-existent as the waitress came back & read 7 wines from her notepad (not being able to tell us anything about any of them)! She explained they were between wine lists, however even if this is the case its fairly poor for any restaurant to not be able to manage this smoothly. We opted for the safe option of Prosecco and beers - after our 2nd bottle of Prosecco, none of the rest of the bottles were cold which the waitress seemed pretty embarrassed about. She also managed to spill half a glass over my friend when pouring it out. The food was ok, we ordered starters to share (the prawns were tasty) and each ordered a main with some vegetables to share too. At the point of mains, you are basically paying for the spectacle only as the portions are fairly small & food is fairly bland & overcooked. I had the seafood special & the salmon was the best thing since its such an oily fish it could take the extra cooking. The lobster was unfortunately a bit chewy. The egg fried rice was also very blend. Each person also got a pair of ramekins with a couple of sauces - these were not nice & didn't compliment the fish at all, one being overly mustardy - assumably to go with steak. For the entainment value, its a bit of fun with a group of friends but I wouldn't go here just for the food. It was also very expensive for what it is - our bill was over £120 per person by the end, which was without desserts & there were a few people driving. I would rather spend that sort of money knowing I'm going to get much better food & service. Unfortunately, we won't be returning and I wouldn't recommend to any food lovers thinking of going.

I’ve been to this branch quite a few times and each and every time it never fails me. We got here around 45minutes early, so we had some drinks from the bar and sat in the seating area until we were called. When our table was ready, we went to be seated. As usual the chefs were very entertaining, making us laugh and really interacting with us which was great! We had the set dinner menu, one was the salmon for approx £29.50 & the other was the chicken for approx £24.00. Both came with onion soup as a starter, a prawn selection, a bowl of white rice & some salad. The best part about the meal was watching the Teppanyaki style cooking right in front of you. We didn’t have dessert because we had no space for it but we did have 4 cocktails throughout. The bill came to £91 including the 12.5% discretionary tip. Oh and if it’s a birthday celebration or special occasion, let them know so they can put the personalised message on the big screen for you in the lounge areas! It’s always a nice surprise

Benihana is a legend in the teppanyaki cuisine and for what it is, it’s fine. This is a place for food theatre where people go with their kids / friends for a fun evening.  Service – the service is good at this Benihana. The reception was nice and efficient and the waitresses are nice, drinks and non-teppanaki items served quickly and they did a good job with special requests on the table. Chefs were fun, engaged the kids and put on a good show for everyone.  Food – Ordered the cod with miso and a side of scallops. The fish was good enough, but the miso was added as a sauce (vs glazed on top) which was disappointing. The unique black cod taste was lost on the grill and the luscious oiliness of the fish was lost. My son ordered beef and eat everything as it was served medium so soft to eat in bite size pieces so he liked it. I am not a fan of the food and only attended on the request of my son.  Value – teppanyaki is always expensive. My young son and I had 2 mains, 1 starter and a glass of wine and it cost us £90. Every time I pay the bill for a teppanyaki dinner, I vow never to come back and year after year the kids beg to come back for the show which obviously made the meal delicious to them.  Benhihana does the teppanyaki show well and kids and groups will enjoy the experience. It seems fully booked all the time so there is certainly an audience for it. But it is not good value for money, and the food is uninteresting and bland (even with their sauce options). If the kids have a great desire to go then we may consider going back, but never for any other reason.

It was half empty. I shared the lobster meal with my guest and it was just enough for a light dinner. It's one of those places you have to visit to see what it's about but the food was nothing special. It's over priced and I think the focus of the visit is on he chef preparing the food in front of you and not actually the quality of the food. Overpriced and my clothes smelt of food when I left the restaurant.

This branch is all underground so no natural light, I prefer the Piccadilly branch as it feels more airy, and has windows. Definitely go and enjoy the fun once, but be prepared to pay for good food and entertainment.

Tables generally have 8 seats (in 2x4x2 format with one long side reserved for the chef) which would be a bit tight for larger customers. However, the place was not busy so we got a table to ourselves! Plenty of good interaction with the chef (Tequila) during the cooking and lovely freshly cooked food straight to the plate in front of you. Service throughout was good. I'd say the prices are a bit high.

Firstly, there was only two or maybe three options for vegetarians and the food that was served was extremely bland. There was no spice, no sauce, no flavour on any of the food that was served. Despite being a vegetarian I was served a dish that had prawn in and was told that it was vegetarian. I was extremely dissatisfied with the food and it was a rip off considering I was still hungry and actually ate again at home. The staff and chef however were extremely hospital and helpful, I could not fault the service but I would not go back for the food. If you are vegetarian, do not waste your time going here, I will not be going back.

We requested the lady who greated us to provide us with a good chef (good as in good entertainment value) and we totally enjoyed our experience. Seeing your food cook in front of you, chef making lively tricks and unique presentation on how the food is prepared really made my kids smile and enjoy there time. Again, if you are only looking for food to consume then yhis place is not for you as you will gind it pricey BUT if your looking for entertainment value, enjoying your food rather than juat eating this is the place to be. Just hope you have a good chef or an experience one which you can always politely ask. Then you are in for a truely unique dining experience.

""do you enjoy it as much the next few times?"".  But anyway I loved my ""Benihana Delight"" set menu. Everything about my experience was great.  Price: It is fairly expensive, your looking at least £30/person and you should really only go if you know you can afford to unleash the cash.  NB: -Wifi available through The Cloud -Reservation recommended -Groups of 8 is perfect as tables are for 8 -Service charge 12.5%  CONCLUSION: if you've never been, your a food enthusiast and not too posh, YOU NEED TO GO.

I arrived with others at 7.50pm checked in at the front of house and they don't me we were the first ones there and to wait in the long/bar area which we did. Ordered drinks and waited for the rest of our party to arrive. Everyone arrived but one person arrived by 8.10pm. Waiters come up and took our drinks order and we sat and waited. By 8.45pm we were wondering what was happening with the table so I asked the waitress and they said that they had given away our table as we weren't all here on time. Outraged I asked why no one had told us. Blank faced ignored the question and told me that we were all late and that's the policy. I then asked to speak to the manager who was just as clueless and rude. Not explaining why he had given away our table without informing us. Arriving early and being told to wait in the bar they knew we were waiting for the table yet still they ignored us. The manager said there's nothing he can do as there are no tables and we should wait. By 9.15pm we were still waiting and by then my party was frustrated, hungry and shocked at the service being received. No apology was given and no one seemed to care. We ended up leaving the restaurant and the whole birthday celebration was ruined. We had all travelled from out of London just to be ignored and treated like rubbish.  I would never return to this place again. Clearly it's popular because of the chefs performances when cooking the food but the service is terrible. No people skills. The manager hasn't got a clue what he is doing. Overall embarrassment.

But other than that, this place was a good find, and hopefully you get to meet stephan who will add to your experience in a positive way.

The service was friendly and engaging.Each member of the team was very knowledgeable and took time to answer any questions we had. Every dish was a taste explosion and it was impossible to choose a favourite. The complex flavours were the result of many processes beyond the means of even the most dedicated foodie. All the food was perfectly seasoned, creatively plated and, hot (one of my gripes at so many fine dining establishments).  This is probably the first review I have written where it is impossible to choose a stand out dish. All were perfectly executed. It is obvious that the menu was design as a whole and not just 6 individual courses served one after another. Thank you Ben and the team for a memorable night.

For the non-egg eater, the mushroom/truffle salad was light, refreshing and tasty.  The staff were outstanding. Thoroughly attentive, chatty and friendly, and the pacing of the meal was perfect.  Changes? The lamb main course was tiny. Throwing an extra lamb variant (maybe lamb three ways, not two) would avoid the noticeable disappointment when the dish arrives. Or through another piece of the loin on the plate.  The wine pairings were excellent especially the use of one of the Orin Swift varietals for the main course.

I imagine I would choose most things on the tasting menu, but every single thing was so good. I cant say enough about our dinner, highly recommended and will go back.  The dining room is beautifully designed, not to close to others and great lighting. The staff were incredible. Obviously it is not cheap, but it's worth it.

The power was packed in the food, the thought and flavors that went into each course. I hope to visit again.

I had bought a three course lunch here as part of a Virgin Experience Voucher for my mum's Christmas present, and wanted to give a 5-star review as it was a really fabulous afternoon. The service was thoughtful and attentive and Francesco was a lovely waiter. I loved the special touches to the experience- the complimentary bread and butter, mini tacos and fudge were all delicious and an unexpectedly kind touch which I didn't expect given that we were paying with a voucher. Plus these extras helped to keep me full for the whole day! The chequerboard menu was fun and I was delighted with my food (as was my mother). I'd really recommend the celeriac starter - a delicious salty sweetness to it. And the carrot cake was soo good. Beautifully presented food and the perfect portion size for a lunch. I have eaten in quite a few 'fine dining' restaurants and Launceston Place stood out for me as an absolutely wonderful experience and excellent food. Plus, my mum, who has never eaten out somewhere like this, had her mind blown by it haha. We will be back!

The quirkiness continues with a board with multiple choices for designing your own menu. We chose the chef’s own taster menu, as is our normality and we trusted his choices. From the amuse bouche to the mint leaf tea, we were regained with superb dishes exquisite flavours and stunning presentation. Reading the history of the place, chef was bought in to seek to restore their Michelin star, from what we observed he is well on the road to that. The greatest surprise to us was the celeriac course. I must confess some hesitation as I don’t find it the most inspiring ingredient, but his take on it was brilliant with genuinely impressive flavours The trout was very gently and carefully presented with subtlety. The grouse was equally thoughtfully presented. One genuine stand out was the amazing yuzu dessert with a very playful presentation. It’s slightly disingenuous to pick out any favourites as that somehow suggests others are less worthy! We genuinely were hugely impressed with all aspects of this experience and we wish them in their journey back to the top

It was superb- eight courses, matched well with wines by a sommelier who not only knew the wines and the location but communicated his enthusiasm for the wine. The food was not only delicious but - and here's a word I've never used before to describe food- witty. The turbot for me was the highlight and the combination of flavours innovative and delicious. I guarantee you have never had egg soldiers like this. This is a great place to come. Service was superb- elegant and fun. It's not cheap- but it's also one of the very best meals I have ever had in London, if not the best. One question- when are the Michelin stars coming?

I am salivating again thinking about the chicken liver parfait and the turbot. And how does one make celeriac taste that good? It's a lovely cosy place and the staff were all really pleasant (That sounds like damning with faint praise. They were great!). All in all, a memorable experience.

I actually don't know where to begin because everything about our dinner here was perfect.  The food is so interesting; their take on 'egg & soldiers' (foie gras in an egg shell) was divine, the souffle has an emoji of the chef on top (niche), the strawberry and sour lime laces at the end of the meal served on a mini clothes horse etc. If it isn't presented in an interesting way, it's displayed beautifully. Also, don't want to give too much away, but just wait until the waiting staff (who are exceptional) come to clear the crumbs away from your table - the method is great and will definitely put a smile on your face. This is so much more than just 'good food'. Unfortunately my photos don't do it justice!  I've recently been to the Woodspeen near Newbury and the Latymer at Penny Hill Park, but Launceston Place takes the top spot. It really was one of the best dining experiences I've had in some time and I can't wait to go back.

Birthday dinner last night was exceptional. Chosen because it had the right combination of romantic interior and raves all over for the food. The raves about the food are well deserved: pix cannot convey ... The delicacy and imagination of every dish was outstanding. The amuse bouche cleverly presented, delicious. The starters excellent. The duck beautifully prepared and presented. The turnip a revelation. The suckling pig: perfect crisp exterior, melt-in-your -mouth tender. Even the bread they make with little hints of chorizo & pecorino, made with lardo, served with two kinds of butter, and the potatoes delivered in a little cart... Five desserts? Kind of over-the-top I appreciate. The sommelier was from Sardinia. The waiter from Basilicata. They both were warm, helpful, and truly were a huge part of making our experience so enjoyable. Service from arrival to goodbyes: impeccable. If you come to London, put this on your list. But make a reservation. This was a Tuesday night early February and every table was taken (and the restaurant is deceptively large: winds around unfolding to five small dining areas, plus a bar.) One of the best meals of our trip. Actually, the best. Grazie mille!

Service is god, wine list good with some reasonably priced wines. My smoked halibut tart with egg yolk was particularly memorable. My only criticism was the online booking system, which ch offered set 3 course lunch £29, Evening standard offer 3course with glass of fizz £35, or a la carte. We booked the former, but were given the middle. Small detail, but needs tidying up. Otherwise superb lunch and great value.

Absolutely exquisite! We love this restaurant. Our most favourite restaurant across the globe. Saturday night is a set menu costing GBP 85. You can add wine pairing for GBP 64. I would highly recommend doing this because Piotr the sommelier, is absolutely world class. His stories about the wine that is being paired are interesting, informative and entertaining. I would take this option just to hear what he has to say. Every dish is presented in an outstanding manner. The taste is simply divine. There is a small bar area at the front of the restaurant where you can have a pre-dinner drink. We did this last night but I would not necessarily say this is essential. They serve some pre-dinner snacks when you are first seated and ‘my helpful hint is that you order a glass of champagne at the table to enjoy with the snacks.’ There is quite a lot of wine that will be served if you take the pairing option but it is all high quality and mixes perfectly with the food. I can only say: for your next special occasion, make a booking and go. Actually, you don’t need a special occasion to go. Make a booking and celebrate anything you can imagine. This is one restaurant you must experience. Highly recommended.

The pre appetiser and bread delicious too, again quirky presentation that seems at odds with the cuisine and restaurant theme / quality. For dessert the pistachio soufflé and pear (shaped) white chocolate dish were both exceptional. Coffee to finish. Just over £300, money well spent for an exceptional experience, will definitely return, thank you to Chef, the Sommelier, Maitre d and the entire team.

It is a warren of small cozy rooms but you don’t feel hemmed in or claustrophobic. Modern decor with lots of natural light.  Had a la carte of veal cheek and lobster to start , extremely tasty and beautifully presented. Not the biggest portions, but they do start you off with amuse buche and some delightful warm bread.  Mains of iberico pork and halibut, which again were delicious and delicately plated but with bold flavours and excellently seasoned.  Cheese trolley followed with a good mix of British and continental. These were very well described and waiters seemed knowledgeable on the flavours and the provenance.  A chocolate delight was then shared to round off an excellent afternoon.  Service was tremendous throughout, attentive but not overbearing with humour and personality.  Look forward to returning. I am sure it will be no time at all before they regain their star.

The restaurant is very nice, divided into different rooms which gives a spacious yet intimate feel. The service throughout was professional but not stuffy or pretentious. I ordered orange wine and I was advised to try it as it was an acquired taste - too true I didn’t like it and we had an interesting conversation about it! It was swiftly replaced with merlot. The food from the 3 course menu was nicely presented with some humorous touches and the portion sizes were perfect. I’d definitely recommend lunch here and I’d go back Thank you to the staff

Our second time here (first was to see the jazz) and it was great! Have to say that ordering straight from the menu was much better quality than the set menu provided on the jazz night we attended.  My king prawn pathia was one of the best I’ve had before, my sister’s tikka masala was far from boring (tasted flame kissed, like proper tikka should) and the Bombay aloo was delicious too.  All of the curries are really chunky and flavourful - in other curry restaurants the sauces seem like they’ve just puréed all the ingredients then thrown in some onion chunks for texture. The food here is the opposite!  The manager is a really nice guy and is candid about how busy it gets/waiting times etc so you always know where you stand.  Sitara is just a lovely little family-run place with great food. We’ll be back!

We have already booked for a return visit so we have learnt our lesson.  We are near a good neighborhood Indian restaurant called Bengal Bertie’s where we have always been very happy and have been well looked after. However, the food and service here was a different level. The spicing was for taste rather then heat although they will make a dish as hot as you like. I had lamb chops which were deliciously tender and tasty. My wife’s chicken was also super. The nan breads were too die for. Raj, the owner, was so hospitable that the people we went with thought he was one of our friends, although he did rename me during the evening.  Amazing that a small restaurant can produce to this standard for this price. A gem.

We noticed the volume of the music was too loud on our first visit but decided to give them a 2nd chance. The 2nd visit was even worse. We had to ask for it to be turned down a couple of times. Unless it's to see the live jazz performances here, no one goes to a restaurant for the music. People go to chat over a meal, not scream across 2 feet of table until they're hoarse and just give up! The food was averagely OK. They wont get a 3rd chance.

Our hotel at north greenwich was very far from this place, so we were initially double minded about our visit here. But after landing here, we knew we made the right decision. The owner (I forgot to ask his name), was very friendly towards us for being from India and most importantly Punjab. We were served the best quality, tasty and delicious food within very short time. Everything was great, from the food to the complimentary drinks offered, and best thing it was very economical. We liked it so much that we visited again on the last day of our trip, after coming back from a long journey from edinburgh. I highly recommend this place for a warm, home like experience and above all, the best, great Indian food in London.

The place was welcoming and the hosts were extremely friendly and there was that desire to please and cater to all the demands from the clients (did not witness any).The quality of food overall was excellent but worth indicating how 'hot' you would like the food to be. The pappadums is an unnecessary addition and remember it's not complimentary. Have it if you want to make a 'meal' of it! Keep you appetisers 'down' in quantity and get ready for the main course. The Jazz idea is fabulous . Sad about the space but playing some 'sitar' on other days(?Ravi Shankar) would be a good break from Jazz as the decibels could get deafening. About the decor: lighter shades on the walls instead of burgundy would make the space appear bigger. But these are only suggestions to improve the already flourishing business! This is a genuine Indian restaurant with genuine Indian food.

I had the Chicken Karahi and my friend had Lamb Dansak, they both were Cooked to perfection. Do yourself a favor - if you are in the Archway area DO NOT go past this restaurant.

"Based upon the numerous positive reviews, we had to give this a go. What really makes this place a standout is the service and hospitality. With a group of 9 ranging in ages from 74 to 7 months, anyone who can tackle all the personalities and questions with a smile and several jokes/chuckles deserves a medal. And then the food! Because of the comfortable atmosphere created by the staff/owners, it makes the burgers all the better. My two kids had the chicken skewers which were so tender and full of flavor. The burgers melted in your mouth. Quite honestly, the general consensus was that the burgers were slightly bland for our collective tastes (my father asked them to spice up his burger and that was ""solved"" by sprinkling some spice as opposed to putting it in the meat), but one cannot question the quality of cooking and ingredients. All in all, it was a really great meal and would recommend it to anyone who has a chance to dine here."

The result was absolutely outstanding, not only because the excellent staff and a stroke of luck got me a table despite the fact that the place is normally quite crowded (a reservation is definitely a good idea, especially for more than two people), but because I discovered that, besides the several delicious burgers, this place serves equally tempting tartare steaks, which I am going to sample during my next visit, so more to come shortly.

We had the cheddar burger and the classic steak tartare and enjoyed it. I would've eaten twice the portion of the French fries if I had been given the opportunity (I'm Belgian after all...)  We had walked 10 km that day so there was definitely room left for a dessert. I picked the moeilleux which unfortunately wasn't too good. I could clearly taste the difference between their homemade burgers and the 'industrial' moeilleux. My partner did enjoy his plate with different kinds of cheese (at 9 EUR) a lot.  All in all very good price-quality ratio (61 EUR for 2 main courses, 2 desserts and 50 cl of whine) which is why we decided to go back tomorrow already.

The main part of the menu offers a variety of meats (salmon, beef, veal for example) that is prepared in any number of styles (about 15 different options): French, Italian, Mexican, Oriental, Greek, etc. You can order one, or a combo of three different ones. We ordered the salmon fixed in Italian style, and the beef fixed in a different style. The meat was incredibly tasty and tender. We also ordered a side salad, that was merely fresh lettuce with a light vinegar and oil dressing, and French fries cooked in duck fat. For dessert, our waiter offered us a dessert not on the menu, which turned out to be very thinly sliced fresh pineapple with a dulce leche (caramel) sauce drizzled on it and little toffee crumbles. It was very good and refreshing. We ordered a bottle of wine recommended by the waiter that we quite enjoyed. We recommend this restaurant if you are ok with Tartare. The total bill was about 75 euros, half of which was the wine.

The owners clearly know a thing or two about hospitality as the good feeling you get here is all about the food and style. All the dishes we ate were simple, exquisite and original - great flavours.

I’m more sceptical of reviews recently, but this place had such great reviews that seemed genuine, so we thought we’d try it. We booked via WhatsApp (which their website details) only an hour before they were opening and got a very quick response. I’ll get my only slight criticism out of the way! It’s a little bit cramped, but it’s so popular I can’t blame them for accommodating as many people as possible. We weren’t keen on the high seats at barrel tables that we were initially allocated, but there was no problem at all in offering us alternative seating at a table. So, onto the food! It’s simply exceptional. The ordering process is such a great idea, with you ticking the boxes next to your choices. We had 5 veggie & vegan dishes that were absolutely superb. In fact the beet hummus with chicory dressed with fig balsamic was one of the best things I’ve ever eaten! My husband and son also had a fish dish and desserts, which they said were equally outstanding. Finally, we couldn’t believe how hard the 2 owners worked. Nothing was too much trouble, and they clearly love what they do. Highly recommended without hesitation.

We went at 6.30pm as didn’t have a reservation and we were lucky we did as many tables were reserved only two weren’t. It was made clear that there were two services and we had to leave the table by 8.50pm but that was plenty time for us.  There was a welcome drink/shot presented to us which was a nice touch and the staff were very friendly and knowledgable. The menu was explained and there are a range of tapas style dishes available to choose from with the suggestion that 4-5 dishes are sufficient for 2 people. We ordered five and we did finish them but easily could have stopped at four.  The food was delicious , in particular the truffle mac and cheese and guacamole. We loved everything to be honest. There is complimentary bread and water on the tables which were appreciated. Each tapas dish is averaging €9.  The decor is relaxed and stylish.  There is a happy hour on drinks between 6.30-7.30pm on beer, wine and soft drinks.

The menu did not seem to change in between trips much if at all.  The service from the owners was outstanding, they were at the restaurant during both of our visits and offered us small apertifs and bread. We ordered some of the tapas items including duck breast, quesadillas, guacamole, very yummy potatoes, and also a few drinks. The portion sizes are decent for the price, we spent around 60 Euros for a nice selection of food and beverages. The food and atmosphere are not fancy, but the dishes are nicely prepared and the restaurant small and cozy. It felt like we were visiting friends and not a restaurant.  Les Apotres de Pigalle is located within a few minutes walk of the Moulin Rouge, and not a far distance from Sacré-Cœur - very close to the Pigalle Metro stop. There are sex shops and such around but if you go from the Metro and don't wander, you won't be seeing much.  Make reservations ahead, since it is a small restaurant it does fill up easily and quickly. During our first visit, there were two other tables nearby with guests from Florida, which was fun.  Les Apotres de Pigalle gets such great ratings because the food they serve and the atmosphere they create is warm and inviting. Both times for us it was a lovely, low-key dining experience.

It really does live up to all the rave reviews. I'd book before hand as we went to the first sitting on a Wednesday and seen people getting turned away at the door. It is a small, cozy restaurant, where you share tables with other guests. But you have enough room to not feel close up against other diners. The two servers were wonderfully helpful, explained the menu in English, gave you a welcoming shot and went out of their way to help you have a great dining experience. We had four of the tapas dishes between us: truffle mac n cheese (delicious, my favourite), ceviche of the day, in our case salmon, (my husbands favourite), the chicken quesadilla, and the sweet potato fries. We then also had the cheese and meat board which had a great selection. We didn't save room for dessert. We also had 5 glasses of wine between us, we were there for their happy hour so they were half price! All of that for the best meal we had in Paris and it came to less than 65€! I would definitely recommend you visit this restaurant on your trip to Paris.

It was really packed so I was lucky to get a place.  I ordered the guacamole, which was a bit pale, quesadillas thar were ok, and the ceviche of the day, a salmon ceviche, which I'm not sure I would actually call ceviche. It was more of a rather dull fusion of sashimi and ceviche. As a whole the ceviche was ok, but it was definitely lame.  The place was packed with tourist (I believe only two French speakers) which is always a bad sign. When I left they asked me to review at TripAdvisor, which I tend to do quite often. However, places that ask their customers for reviews are seldom very good in my experience.  I get the feeling that this has probably been a great some time ago, but that by now it's becoming more of a TripAdvisor tourist trap. There are definitely better ceviche in Paris.

Came here because it had a 5 star rating and was ranked 3rd top restaurant in paris at the time. I'll admit the place looks quite nice on the inside even though the exterior doesn't show it. The food was below average, something you'd eat on the go for a quick lunch. Beef quality was questionable. Not a very clean place, flies inside the restaurant. Cool concept but quality just isn't there. Probably has a high rating because of the students in the area. Wouldn't come back

Got a table without reservation during the week.  The concept is that you can chose from a choice of fish and meats, chose your style and combine the two. The tasting platter is put together by the chef. We especially liked the Tuna Niçoise, a mix we otherwise wouldn't have tried! Definitely recommend that, the Italian veal (like a carpaccio) and the beef house-style. The Poké Salmon was also good, but obviously similar to a normal salmon poké.  The portions of the tasting platter are rather small and we felt like some could've used a bit more spices or salt as they were quite bland. The dessert on the other hand was amazing! We had the speculoos Tiramisu and I would go back just for that dessert! Absolutely great.  Service was quick and attentive although our server seemed to be new. The owner (I assume) was great though.  There's a bus stop right in front of the restaurant.

There were only four entrées to choose from and one was a cheese platter. The other entrée choices were sea bass , wyagu beef and sweet breads. My husband wanted none of them however he chose the wyagu beef. The sauce for the beef was excellent and he enjoyed it however at €135 it should be more than very good . I ordered the Seabass and found it adequate. The risotto with curry that came with the beef also had an excellent sauce. Some of the servers, including James and Amin, were very good. Leopold never brought the citrus vinaigrette I requested and seemed to completely forget it. He also had to be asked to serve us bread. There were many “extras” that were provided at no charge,but being very gourmet,required a receptive palate. I loved the artichoke appetizer bite with curry,but my husband didn’t care for any of them. We ordered a la carte,but with a €90 bottle of wine ( which was the least expensive Bordeaux on the menu) and coffee, our bill before tip was €333. We are world travelers and have stayed at some of the best hotels. Overall, I would give the food a B-. My husband gave it a much lower rating than that. If we had ordered the six course fixed menu with wine, the bill would have been well over €600. You would have had the same four entrees as well. Interesting experience, but we would never go back.

We ordered the eight course tasting menu with the wine pairings, and all was beautifully presented and tasted amazing. The sauces were all subtly seasoned (no additional seasoning needed here), distinctive, and pulled every dish together. I haven’t mentioned the service-impeccable, attentive and friendly. My cousin and I prefer to speak in French (you have to practice!) and they were very tolerant of our efforts. Eight courses can seem daunting, but all were sized perfectly and left you in anticipation of the next.

My birthday happened to fall during our stay and we tried to get a table online but the restaurant was showing as fully booked. We emailed the hotel and they were able to confirm a reservation for us just a few nights before. Imagine our surprise when we showed up for dinner and the wonderful maitre d' escorted us to the Chef's table! We did the 7 course tasting with wine pairing but we couldn't keep track of what number we were on, very quickly. (There were so many extras!) I have some dietary limitations which the chef was able to work around, seemingly easily. With the entire kitchen on show, it was a delightful experience though very intimate at the chef's table. We were already impressed and pleased with every course that came out but when the Wagyu beef course came out- I may have cried some tears of joy because it was perfection in my mouth. I even halted the chef to tell him how amazing it was in the middle of the course. Every pairing was a classic match to the dominant flavors of each dish. The cheese course was just ridiculous. In the sheer quantity and selection. Delicious but that quantity is rough on the stomach of non French diners. The madelines and after dinner pastry they offered to pack up to have the next morning (we were so full!) and we were thankful we did!!! Those madelines were better than any other madeline I had ever had and that snail shell was perfectly executed laminated dough.  We are no strangers to multi course fine dining in NYC. This is the classic French dining experience and this was executed perfectly.

The foie gras was truly exceptional with a flavor and texture I have never tried before but the rest of the plates were very good. The sommelier was also amazing and she gave very good pairing suggestions. The cheese table was amazing with great recommendations from Ms Camille.

The food was excellent. You need to book and reconfirm your booking - which makes sense to avoid empty tables when the restaurant is popular. I replied to an email confirming my reservation, but the following day received a call (after a missed call a couple of hours earlier) advising me that my reservation had been cancelled as I had not reconfirmed. Fortunately, upon indicated that I had confirmed by email my reservation was honoured - but not the sort of mix up you expect from a professorial establishment. The meal was very good, but not outstanding. The wait staff all very pleasant and attentive, but away from the table there was a sense that they were rushing around all the time, which was not entirely necessary. Chose the wine accompaniment as I appreciate having wine paired for particular food. However, for one glass I had a load of sediment in the bottom - this is not what I expect when served by a sommelier. In my wife’s desert she had a piece of baking paper - also not what expect in this type of restaurant. It was an enjoyable meal but with a few minor issues and room for improvement.

We came to Paris for a week, to celebrate my beloved's 50th birthday. I did some research in advance, and decided that this will be the place.  First thanks go to Mariana, who communicated with me in advance of the visit. Professional, prompt to reply, working with us on the 6-course menu (we don't eat meat), adjusting it to our food preferences and the special touches for the celebration.  Then came the evening. Professional welcome, with elegance and grace. Once we got seated, we met James the sommelier. Unbelievably knowledgeable about wines and the profession at large. A delicious glass of champagne to start the evening, followed by an even more divine French red - to die for. On top of it, because we had fish, he recommended - and brought (on the house) - two glasses of white that fit the dish perfectly.  The service from the whole team was superb. SUPERB! Luc was equally professional and friendly, and we engaged in a few conversations about how they run the place, and the world of Michelin stars.  Then came dessert. Or, more specifically, first came the pre-dessert dish. It was followed by two separate dessert dishes, wrapping everything with a chocolate creation of one of the chefs who specializes in chocolate.  We have both ""been around"" and traveled various parts of the world, separate and together - and experienced a variety of restaurants. We unanimously agreed that this was THE BEST restaurant experience of our lives! Sure, it was also the most expensive one - and I would pay it again for this experience, without thinking twice.  Thank you Team Pur' for making this evening so unique for us!"

We had an absolutely superb meal in this spacious yet cosy restaurant where the staff are professional, warm and helpful. We ordered à la carte and had 3 courses each; the restaurant also offers an appetiser, an amuse bouche and a pre-dessert, so you end up with six courses. None of these are too large so you leave feeling satisfied not bloated. There is a good wine list of regional varieties by the glass, and bread (3 types) is topped up as needed. All the courses were delicious, the flavours nicely balanced and the textures memorable; the produce is obviously highest quality and the dishes looked enticing on the plate. Having recently tried a few 1 star restaurants around France on this trip, this is definitely a step up. A fabulous experience!

Her voice was as beautiful as the 9 courses of food I enjoyed an hour later in one of the world's great restaurants, Pur. The amuse bouche sums up the entire meal - it was served on 3 different plates, and included tiny bursts of flavour and texture which set a startling tone to the evening. Only Michelin star chefs with decades of experience can produce such delicate and intimate combinations of taste. The menu is wide and varied, but with such an extra ordinary chef, indulging in the designation and letting him take control as a must. We enjoyed langoustine carpaccio, Challan's duck with eggplant, harissa of piquillos and raspberries, The Cocoa dessert, all combined with astonishingly beautiful flavours.

We went for the Trip Diary menu with matched wines. Not cheap at €275 per person but definitely a special experience.  We had a drink in the bar first as the restaurant wasn't ready for us at 8PM. We got seated just before 8:30. I guess they were trying to avoid everyone sitting down for dinner at the same time.  The service was very professional albeit a little reserved but I guess that is what they are aiming for. The food generally was excellent and the wine pairings were in the main great.  Highlights for us were the fish course with razor clams and also the lobster. The meal was completed with a pastry served with cream flavoured with white pepper - delicious but very filling. The snail starter was OK but not something I would probably try again.  The only downside to our meal was the table of three women who spent the whole evening either taking selfies, playing music on their phones or talking loudly on their phones. Shame people like this are allowed!

Soon after my arrival I contacted the concierge to make a booking for me. At that point in time unfortunately no table was available anymore and I was offered to join the waitlist or make a booking at another restaurant. Luckily, I joined the waitlist which within 24 hours confirmed the booking. My friends and I ended up dining at the chef's table, which can be separated from the restaurant by curtains and provides a more romantic dining experience. We chose Chef Rouquette's 8 course diary tasting menu and wine pairing which was an excellent choice.

We did the wine pairing along with the tasting menu and we were very happy with the knowledge the Sommelier offered. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves fine dinning and is visiting Paris.

It's the morning after the night before and I'm still thinking about the amazing experience at Pur'! I'm not sure I can put down in word how excellent our visit was, but I would honestly say this was the highlight of a very touristy weekend in Paris.  From start to finish this was amazing - we both went for the 6 course taster menu which was easily 11/12 courses and I've not been so full in a restaurant of this quality before! I will say this is a comfortable level of fine dining - the menu and ingredients are not massively intricate yet the results are mind blowing.  The level of service was perfect. My wife for example could not entertain the idea of pigeon (which was beautiful!) which was substituted for beef (also spot on). At 145€ the food worked out with the various amuse-bouche etc at less than £10 per course. Wine/champagne did add a bit to the overall bill as expected in a hotel restaurant but to be honest I felt the evening was worth every penny.  The highlight would have to be the monkfish which was cooked to perfection. The chocolate experience near the end is a must for cocoa lovers! My only issue would be that with a glance at the bill at the end of the night I assumed 20% service had been added and it was only afterwards that I realised two levels of tax (for food and alcohol) had been applied, so actually left without tipping! If anyone at the restaurant reads this, apologies for not concentrating enough in French class!! I hope there is a next time when I can double tip!

Need Better Desserts (3.5 Stars).	"During my stay in Paris, I wanted to have at least one fine dining experience. I chose Pur' since it was a Michelin starred restaurant and they were open on a Sunday. Many French restaurants are closed on Sundays, so I was happy to find a one that was open. You should make a reservation. If I remember correctly, I think I made mine about a month in advance. The restaurant is located in the Hyatt hotel.  The ambiance is very nice. Typical of many hotel restaurants. However, it had a more loungey, but classy, feel which I found relaxing and nice. I liked the lounge like seating as opposed to rows of tables and chairs.  Come dressed nice - you do not have to be too formal - no gowns. But dress as you would when you go to a special occasion at church or formal work function.  I had the 6 course pre-fixe with wine pairings which included:  - Monkfish, Fennel, and Sweet Potato dish - Duck Foie Gras with Green Beans, and Quinoa in a Yogurt/Horseradish Sauce - Beef with Potatoes - A few dessert dishes  The staff was very accommodating to my friends peanut allergy, so I am unsure if the selections are in line with what they actual offer on their menu. I let them know during the reservation period and when we got there, they were very attentive to ensure that they met our dietary needs. In general, the service was superb. I feel confident in saying that it was the best service I had in Paris. Very professional and polite staff.  The wine pairings were superb. Everything paired well nicely. I did not like the port with dessert. However, that is not held against the restaurant as port is considered a dessert drink. I personally just don't care for port. Especially not with dessert. Not sure where that rule was established. lol.  I was a huge fan of all the entrees. It is very difficult for me to pick a favorite. I guess I would have to say the Monkfish. However, the Duck Foie Gras and Beef were cooked perfectly. I loved the layers of flavors. They were hearty without being heavy. They were nicely presented as well. The entrees itself would give this restaurant a 5 stars.  I gave 3.5 tar because of the desserts. I did not care much for the desserts. In fact, I do not think I really remember any of them. They consisted a big portion of the meal (8 in total I think). I do think I had a dessert with brie - and I remember eating it. This says a lot because no one can get me to eat brie. I usually do not have the pallet for it (it's possible it wasn't brie). But generally, the desserts were not memorable.  As an American, and this being my first fine dining experience of this caliber, it was difficult for me to get used to the tiny food. I am big into nutrition, and technically, the food is perfect portion sizes. However, it didn't prevent me from wanting a juicy turkey burger afterwards. I did not leave full.  I stopped at the restaurant bar after dinner. They had some very unique cocktails. I ordered the ""Puki Puki"" simply because I liked the name. It was a very beautiful and tastey cocktail. Very tastey cocktail - more memorable than the dinner wine. I vote that all restaurants should offer cocktail pairings with pre-fixe dinner. That would be nice!  The 6-course pre-fixe will run you about 235 Euro - not bad considering some other fine dining resteraunts were almost double."

In Paris, the competition in the fine dining category is fierce.  It’s as if every night is a playoff game and everyone is gunning for the title. Here, a Michelin Star might actually be worth more than in other cities. And if you’re lucky enough to be on vacation, with back-to-back dinners at this level, you would imagine that someone has to lose. It was with this pressure we dined at Pur, having just experienced newly starred Saturne the night before.  Would there be space for its unique take on starred excellence?  Pur is a classic fine dining experience. This is not a let down. Imagine the finest ingredients in unique combinations. Now imagine them served at a level that take six dishes and create wonderful arc.  While identifying individual dishes is useless as Chef Aie Okabayashi is sure to adjust the menu based on what’s seasonal, the one prevailing taste we encountered was “smoke”. Similar to the essence of barbecue, there were hits of smoke and wood in unexpected delicate places like fish. Yes there was a duck course that was one of the best…the skin by alone could have been a delicacy.  Lest we forget, two of the six courses were desserts, with a palate cleanser that could be a dish in itself. Actually, the that cleaner tart “soufflé” was probably our favorite, and the pastry chef, who busily prepped dishes all night next to our chef’s table, humbly admitted it was his as well.  We opted not to commit to the wine pairings, but the Sancerre and Margeux by the glass were excellent. If you prefer cocktails, their take on the Moscow Mule is worth the price. And don’t be intimidated by the six-courses. It’s the right size and takes about three hours, so it was well-paced.  Finally, the service was superb. It doesn’t hurt that we were seated at the chef’s table with a window into the kitchen where Chef was making sure no detail was overlooked. And yes she made one trainee remake a simple amuse-bouche simply because he failed to sprinkle the dust in the right direction. And an anniversary cake for a couple celebrating theirs was reset because it sat a few minutes too long.  Situated in the sexy Park Hyatt Vendome, this is far more than a “hotel” restaurant. It’s epic…they brought their A-game on an average Tuesday evening. But hey, this is Paris, and the next Michelin wannabe is right around the corner!  The good news is that Pur has the goods, elegance and fine creations, to keep that star shining.

Not only was the food and the service exceptional, but for some reason, we were lucky enough to be randomly seated at the Chef’s table where we could actually watch the food preparation in detail. We elected to go with the Chef’s tasting menu which they happily adjusted to accommodate some of my wife’s seafood aversions. Every dish was amazing. From the sommelier, to the waiters, to the chefs, not a single detail was overlooked in providing us a top notch dining experience. Bravo Pur'… Well done!

They have 3 choices for dinner - 2 degustations and a la carte. I opted for the 6 course degustation. 3 amuse bousche came first and they were ok. The 1st course was white asparagus. Not a big fan, but it was ok. Seabass followed and it was good and well coordinated with all the other elements. Veal was the main and it was very good. A heavy melted cheese course followed. It was ok but too heavy and cheesy to finish. The strawberry and chocolate desserts finished the set and they were great. Petit fours were also too much for me by then  Service is very good as expected  Pur-fect

The food and service was exquisite, more of what you'd expect from a 2 or 3 Michelin starred restaurant in the UK than what is only a 1 star in Paris.  At €125 this is good value compared to other restaurants of a similar standard in Paris.  The menu was excellent and each course was a delightful experience full of great flavours and textures.  The service was commendable and with only one sitting you have the table for the whole night. This is a restaurant for a special occasion and a wonderful experience that will will not forget.  Thanks to Jean-Francois and his team. It was a pleasure.

It was a venison ""hunter's pie"" served as part of a venison two-ways main course. The other part was the most perfectly cooked piece of venison I have ever had, but the pie was life changing. I had never had venison served in a shredded bbq-esque presentation before, nor had I have had mashed potatoes with white chocolate. Now I wonder how I could have missed out on such a genius combination for so long. I will never see mashed potatoes the same way again.  Like the Park Hyatt hotel itself, where I stayed, there's really nothing to fault about my meal here. If anything, the amuse were just fine (but interesting and creative), and then the meal just kept building strength upon strength. The desserts were astoundingly good. The only negative I can think of is that I had way too much food (and wine), and almost fell asleep. But then the pre-dessert refresher did it's job at waking me up for the actual desserts that pushed our meal past midnight.  Many reviewers suggest another star will be awarded to Pur' in time, and it's not hard to see why. It really felt like a 1-star restaurant cooking above its level, and therefore it was almost a relative bargain, if you can call a E200pp+ meal that. And if you're staying at the Park Hyatt already, it is also crazy convenient to stumble back into bed!"

The bread and wine selection are exquisite, (a wine is associated with every dish), the service is outstanding and the food is mouthwatering. Every course was a beautiful surprise for our palates, and, for the cherry on the top, we met the chef before leaving and he gave us little cookies to take home and eat the next day. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Paris!

We also selected the wine recommendation proposed in the menu.... There was a nice course after course experience and tasting... The service was perfect and very professional. We felt that it was going a bit too fast, we informed them and they adjusted. The kitchen is opened, you can see and feel the activity of the team, without disturbing the cosy atmosphere.

Though I have some reservations about the materials and style of the Park Hyatt Milan, I wanted to check out the Paris location. Indeed the ""look and feel"" of the entry and lobby areas is quite similar, as is the building itself, a building with interior courtyard covered by a glass cupola. The contemporary clean look, the shiny pretty marble floors, are marred by what in my opinion is some pretty disquieting 'art-work' and decor (see pictures of the spooky light fixtures and creepy (in my opinion, alright) paintings). I'm thinking, with all the universally loved and beautiful and creative and glee-giving art out there, how could they have made these choices? What message are they trying to convey to us? ""Watch out or the creepy light fixure men will descend upon you and scratch your eyes out?"" I dunno.  To the restaurant; we were seated in the cupola area which happened to be packed at lunchtime. The entry to the kitchen is equipped with a long table upon which all that takes place can be viewed as reflections in surround mirrors on walls and ceiling, angled precisely for that purpose. We were offered a cocktail and when we expressed interest in a coupe of champagne, we were elegantly described the houses, vintage of choices, last but evidently not least was the hyatt labeled something or other famous-house made especially to celebrate the hotel's 10th anniversary. I asked, ""it isn't $3000 a glass is it? "" and was told, well it is more expensive than the other types but it isn't that much..."" We would ""laugh"" about that later when we got the bill and saw that over half the amount was attributable to the €45ish per glass of champagne orders!  I had the raw scallops, beautifully presented, but taste-free, much to my increasing-with-each-bite dismay. There were the very tasty dried berry dotting the plate adding beautiful color, and the paper-thin sliced radish so thin it was translucent, and some other exotic plant which were the tastiest things on my plate. The St. Jacques were perhaps defrosted? Dunno. I forget what my husband had, and which I tasted too. I guess that sums that up.  Delicious bread products, as always, the hand-finished patty of butter (not to my liking though).  Great service, cool ambiance, but very loud as the cupola created an acoustic bubble.  Happily I did not hear any sound from noisy printers like one hears in the Milan Park Hyatt.  All in all, great atmosphere, great service, stick to the regular vintages of champagne unless you are on an expense account, and don't rely on the menu offerings to satisfy a need for very tasty cuisine.  Oh, and did I mention the artwork? Have a look. Maybe some people will enjoy these pieces, which are probably even famous and were probably very costly too. And beware of those light-fixure men; watch your eyes!"

Let me start with the dessert. Honestly, the Maitre can be relaxed now and lay back. I have to admit: one chocolate dessert on the menu and I will go for it. This one was exceptional. Great Praline mousse, nice chocolate sphere, nice crumble combination. It was death of chocolate, a very nice one. So let me begin with the starter. The champignons de bois had an excellent taste, an amazing texture. The salad topping was not mine, but all in a bite very good. The main course was an Argentine Entrecote, cooked to perfection. All these dishes are presented in a good manner at a nice location. The ambiance is great, following the theme of this restaurant. The host and the staff in general: keen, nice, helpful and attentive. Nothing to complain about and to be honest: we ate worse at Michelin Star restaurants. The location of the restaurant cannot be found without TripAdvisor. Hence, no mass tourism and no tourists who want to eat cheap and fast. We had a great evening and an absolutely fantastic dinner.

I would say don’t miss the “perfectly cooked eggs” (photographed here). It is true that by the time the place was packed, the owner and his assistant had challenges keeping up with every one of us as promptly, but it made us feel more like a genuine neighborhood experience, and we enjoyed watching everyone from our corner table. Thank you to everyone who reviewed this and helped us find this wonderful hidden gem. Highly recommended.

He seated the 4 of us at an odd table right up in front of the bar. We were unsure, but as the evening unfolded we learned this was exactly the spot to have. He could watch over us from the bar like a wonderful host. We also learned he custom made the table which worked out exceptionally well. He made the wine suggestions which were spot on. Every course was wonderful. I have never taken photos of my food, but there is first time for everything. We left feeling we were leaving someones home. A night to remember and he and the staff were gracious to our limited French, we even shared laughs about how bad we were in the language department.

I chose this restaurant because of the high ranking in TA (n°4 in Paris). The neighborhood is not all that good but I can't say I felt unsafe at any time on our way there and back by metro. The hospitality is very good: we got a warm welcome and all through the meal it stayed that way. After ordering some cocktails we had to wait for more than 1 hour before we got our menus! (after having asked for it). We then got some bread to cover the gap. The entry was presented beautifully on a plate but the mackerel was just smoked mackerel, nothing special. We ordered a beef medaillon for mains: the taste of mine was good and juicy but my wife's was actually bleu whereas it should have been medium rare. Also the temperature in the restaurant kept rising up till the point it was too hot to stil order dessert. We fled the restaurant. So a lower score to get the overall score back to a realistic level.

Sea scalop dish come on time from the kitchen but served bit late, hence temperature was not good, it would be much better that it was served on time. Knife for meat dish was with wooden handle which is against HACCP standard. One of the service personnel had scent of cigarettes on his fingers (must say this was noticed when bill was presented, not during food service) All the rest was very good and food was really tasty. Reception was very professional, very good and clean rest room facility. Price wise this was on high end side. Still, I recommend this place.

The ambience is warm and relaxed, and the service we received was attentive and courteous at all times, from everyone. We took a la carte (rather than a tasting menu) - crab starters, monkfish for my wife and duck for me. All excellent, and my wife's avoidance of gluten and lactose was dealt with as no problem at all. Worth its star, and worth a visit. We'll go back.

The staff was awesome. We were not rushed in any way - in fact - we were there for about 3 hours. But start to finish, it was just an excellent meal, an excellent experience in total. It's pricey for sure, but in this case, what we received matched the price (which isn't always the case). We spent 3 weeks between France, Italy, and Switzerland and we all agree that 114 Faubourg is among the top 2 restaurants during our trip. And I'll go a step further and include it among the top restaurants in our State-side dining experiences (with the remaining best being in NYC). Truly a great restaurant and so happy we visited.

It is fun. It is beautiful, It is not stuffy, yet elegant. It is historic. The dishes from the kitchen do not disappoint, but delight. My secret suggestion is to treat yourself first at LE BAR (same hotel as 114 at Le Bristol), then dinner and dessert at 114. It will be memorable.

Service this year felt remarkably different. In the past we always received a gluten-free menu for my celiac husband without asking (I specify in my booking that he needs a gluten-free meal). This year we had to ask for it. I ordered a cocktail and my husband an aperitif. Before we even received them, the waiter asked if we wanted to order our meal. I don't think I have ever had that happen in a Michelin-starred restaurant. It felt like dining in a cafe. We said we would prefer to have our drinks and then order. In prior years we always looked forward to the mignardise at the end of the meal. They would always tell my husband which things he could have and fill in with macarons if too many of the usual mignardise had gluten. This time we noticed we were the only table that didn't receive any. We asked the waiter and he said that my husband would not be able to eat them (not true - they included macarons). I asked why did I not get any. He said he assumed that I would not want any if my husband could not have any. That's like saying I would not eat bread at a meal if he couldn't have any. We asked for a manager and he apologized and we got our mignardise. I gave my husband ones that I knew were OK for him and they obviously were since he had no effect from them. The manager gave us his card and assured us that next time he would make sure we were properly taken care of. These are small things, and the cocktail and food and wine were excellent, but we have been here quite a number of times before and the the service was flawless and friendly in the past to the point where a waiter we had on an earlier visit would come over and say hello. Also, it does have a Michelin star and you should not have to worry about anything in such a restaurant. Hopefully this is an isolated incident and does not reflect their normal service.

We had a delightful business dinner in a quiet corner of the restaurant, three beautifully prepared courses with wine and champagne. The only let down of the night was England losing to Croatia. Would love to come again, so long as someone else pays the bill. It is top class, and the prices reflect that.

Our flight was supposed to arrive at 8:20pm, and their last order was at 10:15pm (be aware that even though they offer 10:30pm reservations on La Fourchette, they don't actually do that), so I initially canceled because I was worried we'd miss the reservation. They were exceedingly nice and understanding during the email exchange, and so when we arrived on time and realized we could still make it, we had our hotel call them, and they were able to accommodate us.  Particularly for a late night dinner, the meal was better than I could have expected. The servers were kind and didn't rush us at all even though we ordered the chef's menu. Particularly memorable was the artichoke soup which was divine, the best I'd ever had with bits of artichoke mixed in with the velvety smooth soup. My husband, who is usually a non-meat eater, said the lamb was one of the best he had tasted. If you come here, you must have the bread, even if you are trying to cut down on carbs. It's absolutely delicious. On this night, we had something that looked like parker rolls, but actually tasted like a nice focaccia, and a perfectly baked sourdough slice.  If you are a dessert lover like me, you will love the long list of some of the most scrumptious choices I've seen at a restaurant in a long time. The menu came with a caramel mille-feuille, which I enjoyed, but I also saw tantalizing plates of soufflés, berry tarts etc etc making its way toward other tables. I would love to come and just eat all of their desserts.  The restaurant was located inside the Bristol hotel, which is a former palace. The warm and unpretentious service combined with the amazing food even made me curious about staying here next time.  Pricewise, this is a one Michelin restaurant, so it's in the typical range of similarly rated establishments. Frankly, however, this was a better meal than two-Michelin places we've been to on out previous trip two months ago, so from that perspective we considered it to be, maybe not a bargain, but completely worth it.

A rare sight in Paris! From the lady taking your coats to the waiters, everybody takes care of you and wants to make sure that you leave the place smiling. This is a very high class brasserie and it is on the expensive side, but worth the money. A carpaccio of scallops came nicely presented on a shell and seaweed which created a beautiful smell, as if you were on a beach. The riz-de-veau with young spinach and a taste of cinnamon was again a treat, as was the souffle as dessert. The guests were of all ages and origins. Compared with the price of the food, I found the wines very reasonably priced. Thanks for a great evening!

The partridge with Foie Gras is a signature dish, comparable to the unique lobster experience at Gleneagles Hotel, as a massage of your palate. The wines (not included) are expensive, but you should definitely go for it, and take the sommelier's advice.  Time flies here, but you'll remember every minute.

The food was good, but not Michelin star level. The service was odd. We ordered wines to go with the dinner (gave sommallier the opportunity to pick up the right ones) and tought they will bring different ones with starter and main course. But they brought the main course wines in the beginning and we needed to ask more wine for main course. The service and flavour experience wasn't worth of money. Comparing to Restaurant Pur this Le 114 Faubourg wasn't the place to go.

Before I get to the food it is worth saying that the seating, décor and staff are all really wonderful. Just such a rare treat to sit in an environment like this and be treated with such charm and understated professionalism. We had the oxtail ravioli and award winning game pate to start. Both superb. Followed by cod and scallops again both just dreamy. Chocolate Soufflé and the millefeuille as puddings. My wife was totally silenced by the soufflé and said not a word uttering weird sounds as she finished the dish in 7 minutes flat. Sublime she said. All complemented by a lovely Sancerre. Not a lot more to say other than this is the most deserved one star I have ever been in.

However this is not a stuffy and overly formal dining experience but is contemporarily styled with some left of field options as well as some traditional old favorites. The amuse bouche of warm lobster was a stella beginning to a fabulous evening with lovely pink champagne and moving on to a delightful Provencal rosé. Dessert was heavenly as was the aged Calvados to finish of perfect evening. Staff were knowledgeable about each dish and very helpful, indeed they welcomed the opportunity to discuss the menu in detail. So price wise its one of those places where if you need to know how much it will cost you can't afford it. Price however should not be a barrier to enjoying a wonderful evening in delightful surroundings. After all what price can you put on a memory that you will never forget?

Restaurant ambience is alright but the tables are stacked too close together to become uncomfortable (you may end up facing person from the next table almost directly into the face and it may become quite awkward. For the Michelin-starred restaurant I was surprised that the n1 item in the list of mains was Le cheeseburger... And that there were people there who actually ordered it. I guess I expect more haute cuisine but tastes of course differ. We decided to go for fixed price menu. I had mushroom soup with duck foie gras ravioli and steak tartare. Both dishes were very good with soup little less so due to somewhat hard dough used to prepare ravioli. We also had 1/2 bottle of pouilly-fume which was delicious. My wife had duck Pte in a crust (delicious) and deep fried whiting which was ok but very simple, basically a fish and chips without batter and chips.  End of the lunch was coffee with chocolates provided on the side. We've also received small gift of another box of chocolate at departure. Service was fantastic throughout.  Overall very good experience but next time we will probably order from the main menu.

Beginning with an amuse bouche that was ideal for the Paris heat wave we were experiencing, the rest of the meal flowed as though it was individually designed for us. We will have yo return next year so that we can experience this amazing restaurant again. (Or perhaps we should just move to Paris!)

Having stayed at Le Bristol (and dined at 114) on a number of occasions, they introduced a vegetarian menu following some feedback during a previous stay. At Christmas, I’d seen significant improvements overall, providing some further feedback on the mains specifically (see previous review). With an unexpected return visit in March, I looked forward to my dining experience.  The amuse bouche of scrambled eggs black truffle and chives was excellent. The starter - a mesclun truffle salad - lacked finesse (noting I later discovered this had been updated on the main menu but not the vegetarian menu, which still had it as a signature dish in the ~ 40 euro mark when in fact it had been replaced by a basic lettuce leaf salad with a small amount of grated truffle). See photos. As per my previous visit, the mains were still uninspiring and frankly a lazy selection of basic vegetables – noting the morels were extremely salty. The mille-feuille dessert was very enjoyable.  Service was inattentive – 15 minute waits were frequent for clearing plates, asking for the sommelier to their arrival, etc.  On advising the Maître d' of my initial disappointment with the starter, and on providing feedback on the experience as a whole, he was very professional. And assured me the feedback would be noted.  As Hotel Le Bristol prides itself on being a level above most hotels, and commands a premium for such, I sincerely hope improvements are made.  Note – I appreciate France is not renowned for being vegetarian friendly, however as a restaurant attached to a premium hotel catering for largely international guests, expect better.

TOP service and quality	It was the second visit to the Bristol Hotel (unfortunately I could not stay there yet) as I tried Epicure two years ago.  Though first '114' experience and I must say that this was the most uncommun 1-star-restaurant we have ever been to!  When walking into the restaurant hostess greeted and guided us to a nice table (by the way: if you want to have a nice and tranquil dinner go for the upper level as they feature an 'open' kitchen on lower level which may be a bit noisy... )  The reason why 114 is awarded 1 star is an A-Level-Service and dishes of exceptional quality!  And we appreciated the fact that you do not feel to dine in a 'hotel-restaurant' because it has a separate entrance from the street.  The menu basically gives the choice of some nice meat and fish courses (salmon was over-the-top!!!) and so far it is the only michelin-starred restaurant serving a burger...  Well we are looking forward to being back soon :)  Greetings to the whole Team

I read people crying about expensive in here, but really it was not more than what you expect for this quality. This is on my ""come back to"" list. Go and enjoy.  Also have to say.

The title of my review says it all really. Firstly, the food was lovely. My wife and I have pretty similar tastes so we both opted for the ravioli, then shared the wild chicken for two and then had the cheese instead of dessert. All were top quality with a special mention regarding the quality of the chicken; so different to a typical farmed bird. To drink we shared a fabulous bottle of Condrieu Blanc followed by a lovely glass of Burgundy with the cheese.  The surroundings were very pleasant. We sat upstairs. Our table was a little close to the one next door but luckily the rather loud couple left quite swiftly - we're usually the last ones to leave so we weren't in any rush.  What really stood out for us here was the quality of the service. We were looked after from the moment we walked in until our waiter escorted us personally out to our taxi after the meal. When the French get their act together like this they do it better than anyone else. Merci.

That was weird. We had to redistribute the toppings ourselves to get what we wanted.  The pizza was tasty but the dough was very thin and didn't hold up under the toppings. This a pizza that requires a knife and fork.  Why were we brought a basket of foccacia with the pizza instead of before, to munch on while we were waiting?  The caprese salad consisted of a lot of cut up cherry tomatoes and a big hunk of mozzarella cheese resting on a bed of arugula. It needed balsamic vinegar.  We went because it was so highly rated but I was unimpressed.  The servers are very pleasant. Perhaps they were understaffed the night we went because there were definitely not enough people handling the front of the house.

So we did not expect much. But then we got all and even more. Small place with just the right decor and really excellent staff. We did not go for the caviar tasting menu that is a signature of this restaurant but got caviar with the second entree. Very good. But also all other dishes from the tasting menu were lovely balanced in taste and imaginative as well.

Very plesant and professional staff, moderate prices. Worth to visit while in Paris, dinner time reservation is a must.

We weren’t disappointed. The place is a bit old fashioned. The main place is not too big but it has additional space at the back and maybe upstairs. The gentleman who served us was very kind. He spoke with us from time to time and made us feel welcome. We took the tasting menu, which was excellent. We needed some adjustments with the food, which wasn’t a problem. The food and deserts were delicious. Together with a very nice bottle of Burgundy, we paid 240 Euros for two people. We will return!

There are two or maybe three very obvious critical success factors for an excellent restaurant:  1. Excellent food 2. Excellent service 3. Pleasant surroundings/atmosphere  And I am very pleased to say that the Boutary excels in both the food and service in what can be described as a warm and cosy surrounding. In fact, it has been quite some time since I have experienced such a high standard of service coupled with a an exceptional good meal.  Caviar is obviously well represented on the menu and if you like caviar, I can certainly recommend it as you will not be disappointed. The caviar is exceptional as either a taster or within the menu where it is an integral part of the meal.  For those that enjoy caviar, you will appreciate the difference between what is typically a more production style caviar to something that is far more refined and as such far more pleasurable for the pallet.  While the restaurant is not inexpensive for Paris, the price is certainly in line with both the exceptional food and service - well done !  Would I return ? Can't wait !

A cheerful welcome was already a good sign . They seated us upstairs where we appreciated the decor all done around black red and white with an interesting illumination. The menu offers different choices from a degustation menu that involves also different wines from menu a la carte . We decided for a la carte and a bottle of Sancerre 2016 . But first We could not renounce to the temptation of tasting some beluga caviar which was excellent . The wine was excellent although it never reached the perfect temperature . My first course was bonito in tataki sauce which was delicious except for the chipped dish in which it was served . As a main course I choose a turbot with artichokes cooked in 3 ways, clams and a symphony of tastes that were exquisite . We were extremely pleased also with the perfect service and by meeting the creative chef .A place worth to return .

Visited for my husband’s 50th birthday. Exquisite food, beautifully presented with excellent service. We went for the 5 course taster menu, and added the caviar to start (one Beluga, one not for comparison) with the premium paired wines. Worth splashing for the extras. Our waiter was so knowledgeable about the caviar, food and wine and made it a really special occasion for us. The whole experience was extraordinary, one of our most memorable ever meals. Go for the taster menu and wines and put your trust in the extraordinary kitchen and front-of-house staff, you won’t regret it.

Tucked away in the trendy Marais district of Paris, not too far from Notre Dame cathedral, surrounded by many independent shops and galleries, it is a small red fronted building which doesn’t look much from the outside. However, the food is nothing like the understated exterior. They offer either a 5 course tasting menu or a la Carter, and they seem to specialise in various types of caviar. The tasting menu was a real wow, specialising in classic French dishes with a a twist. Foie Gras with mussels, smoked potato with caviar, fresh pollock with cream sauce and fantastic duck with girolles and pumpkin. Dessert of pears with ginger was one of the best I’ve ever tasted. Service was impeccable - friendly, efficient and very knowledgable. If you in Paris, you should definitely make a trip to Boutary.

We both finished with apple tart which was just ok. It is a very small restaurant so make sure you book.

The place was full but it is also very small so not a lot of room to fill aniway.  The waiter was friendly in a French kind of way, ok for us but can get annoying.  We were recommended some dishes and despite the quality of the ingredients, the flavors just didn't work out well together. The crab starter has a horrible gelatin and the fish eggs didn't taste anything. My main dish was ok (slow roasted meat) but the fish had a very strong sauce. The ""light"" deserted was e regular mango mousse, not good or bad.  At almost 50EUR a head I would expect much more for a neighborhood small restaurant. I personally had much better meals in Paris, with also well chosen ingredients and much better execution.  If you like strong dishes and are in the neighborhood there is no harm in trying, for us it wasn't a smart choice."

The previous time they had these incredible twirly pasta I had never seen before - custom made for them apparently - which gently caressed the unbelievable tomato sauce... if tonight had not actually been better I don't know... I'd have to demand the old pasta back. And then there's the octopus... I had tried their salad before, amazing octopus salad, and today was surprised that there was a different octopus. Brocolli - which I hate - and greek yogurt, with grilled octopus. Hate brocolli? OMG no! It was incredible! The octopus too of course... OK I'm rambling. The place was sold out and they graciously let me sit anyway... the other three large tables were devouring the food. Do not pass this place up. I'm making sure I'm back in 2 weeks."

When coming to restaurant of this type, I would highly suggest just going with it. Take the meal as the chef intends the experience to be and make sure to absolutely add the wine pairings. The flavors of the perfectly chosen wines are essential to the full experience and appreciation of the complex flavors. We have had meals of this type several times but this was definitely one of the best. The intricacy of the preparation to pair multiple different types of ingredients (sometimes ones you would not think would go together) to get a specific flavor or texture is truly amazing. I can’t really cook much of anything so this of course is even more special for me – as I LOVE to eat great food. Only 20 seats in this compact and quaint place so make sure you book well in advance if you want this experience. The staff was wonderful and the evening was perfect – especially since it was our 25th anniversary.

Don’t be put off by first impressions; the skill and passion that goes into each dish is amazing, the care that goes into in the sourcing of ingredients is obvious, and the wine pairing (it is absolutely worth taking this) is stunning.  We genuinely had one of the best meals that we have ever had in Paris, and have every intention of returning at our next trip.  Important you go with the flow; there is no menu - you just take what is placed in front of you (don’t worry- they ask about allergies etc first!) and expect to be surprised and delighted by the unexpected combinations and flavours. Nothing is quite what you expect. Some of the bigger dishes exude unusual flavours from unexpected combinations, and some of the single-mouthful courses are simply a delight.  Book now!

Were here on a Saturday evening in May. Set menu including wine menu. Wonderful high quality food! Modern experimental yet down to earth in a very positive way. Room for around 20 people.

We had a lovely multi-course meal with wine pairings that was both creative and well-presented. Very warm and friendly service. Yes, you don't have a say here as to the food presented, but it is well worth the risk and detour. We intended to go to Montmartre anyway, and this is just a 5 to 10 minute walk to the Sacre Coeur. Heartily recommend.

At this small 10 table restaurant off the beaten path you have to: have reservations a month out and be somewhat adventurous because there is no menu whatsoever.  If you have any food allergies you tell them and from that point on, you're off on a fantastic trip. You have no idea what you are going to be served.  The menu changes by what is in season. All the dishes were out of the ordinary. The sauces, the presentation, the subtle flavors in each one were amazing and different.  I won't try to describe each dish but we had ingredients from exotic mushrooms to quail, from fish ( pollock ? ) to fresh grapes & tomato. It's a 7 course menu but we counted at least 9.  Expensive - yes - about 200 euro with the 4 wine tasting for both of us.  Every table was taken and we can see why.

Great food, lovely people!	We had read some of the reviews and some were not so favorable so we went with a little trepidation. No need to be concerned at all and possibly in 6 weeks of travelling this was certainly one of the best experiences we had at a mid range price. Firstly the chef, the host and the server, were extremely warm and friendly people who could not do enough for you to make this a really exceptional experience. I can't possibly remember each course and they did come quickly although at the right time, other reviews said they felt rushed, this was not our experience at all and we found that each course was paced perfectly. I ate things I had never eaten before and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. As always there are a few things that could make the experience one notch higher. The restaurant is small and it was hot, we suggest LED bulbs and the owner did turn the lights down a little later in the evening. It is also a little noisy when you get that person who wants to tell everyone their news. Because the restaurant has hard surfaces, brick wall, high ceilings the noise bounces, so some soft sound absorbent panels hung from the ceiling horizontally might help with that. I hope this restaurant survives, it is a tough market but we thought they were doing everything right and I would definitely return next time I am in Paris.

Booking in advance is a must which we did (1 month in advance is possible). The 7-course dinner is overall delicious. We would have preferred to have at the table a menu so that we know what we were eating. The price is very reasonable (65 €). We also took the acoompanying wines (35 €), which one can taste first and if not OK, you can have another wine. Overall, the wines were very nice. To summarise, this was a very good experience and for Paris standards, a very good value for money.

We chose the Chef's menu with all surprises and with a glass of wine to go with each plate - good choice. A lot of surprising tastes, which were very special and enjoyable. Service was very good. In any case, we promised to come back another day, which we certainly will.

Went for my wife's birthday, as one of many culinary experiences over 5 days and this was surely one of the best. Food was great, with the pollock and especially the quail being the highlights. On the downside, the fish carpaccio wasn't as exciting as the one we - incidentally - had at Ze Kitchen Galerie for lunch. Also, while it says the menu is 7 courses, it is worth noting the first course is really an amuse bouche, while the last just petit four. Wine selection was excellent and good value at €30. Service was good, although our waiter seemed to try too hard (i.e. hyping the courses and experience a bit too much) and did a bit of an embarrassing faux pas at the start of the meal - clearly not intended, but still not a great way for my wife to start her birthday dinner...

The chef was super nice and when i wanted to know the name of and ingredient he tipped for me in my phone.  we tried to come back before leaving paris and it wasn't posible fully booked for the week so this restaurant is a new reason to comeback in 2018. i hope this restaurant continues to evolve and gain the recognition it deserves i can see a michelin star approaching

Also one of the few places in Paris we've found that actually offers a decent choice of premium gins, while in Belgium even the most modest 'brasserie' has a couple of gins to choose from. The maitre does an excellent job and the paired wines were excellent. We paid €100 each for a gin and tonic, the menu with paired wines and a cognac. That is great value for food this good.

As others have mentioned this is a fixed menu only type of restaurants so you need to be flexible but what came out of the kitchen on the night we were there did not disappoint one bit. What was interesting is that unlike many of the other restaurants we went to during our trip to France, Aspic offered a wine pairing with the meal which was quite nice and added an extra layer to the experience.  Service was overall good but you need to go into this with the right expectation that this is a lean operation. As far as I could tell there was the chef in the kitchen and one waitress for about 12 tables. It didn't feel slow or anything but it wasn't ""high touch"" either.  Overall we were pleasantly surprised with the experience. When the check came in, we were even more surprised at how affordable this experience was. Given the quality and creativity, I don't think it's going to stay this way for long so you better go and enjoy it!"

Out of our 5 days we spent in Paris, this was the best meal/experience we had by far. It was such a great find by my boyfriend, who wanted to take me somewhere special for my birthday on January 4th and had booked it from trawling through TripAdvisor, not that he had to trawl far. This little restaurant is so quaint and delightful, it has so much charm, from the place itself to the waitresses and chef who all severed us at one point. A little music (or a tad louder) would have only added to the lovely ambiance. To start we had a gin cocktail as an aperitif whilst we perused over the wine menu. We were then given cured meat, bread and home made butter - this butter was to die for. We selected a bottle of wine (all great prices compared to other restaurants) and soon after our dishes began arriving one by one. I can't actually remember what was in every single one but I do know they were all delicious! The octopus was so tender, the fish lovely and light, the beef was so flavoursome, the little onion thing was amazingly tasty (how did you make an onion taste like that?), the dessert was nice but I would have preferred something a little lighter. I did get a candle in my dessert which was really sweet, my boyfriend couldn't remember mentioning that is was my birthday. We thoroughly enjoyed every last bite. The waitress was so lovely and friendly, we also figured out it was the chef who served us also which we loved. You could see their passion for food when they served us each dish and told us all the components.  I love tasting menus, they are my favourite, especially surprise ones! You are always watching and listening to see what the person opposite you is getting so you know what to expect. This is also amazingly great value for money, at only 49 euros each. Leave about 2-2.5 hours to enjoy the experience. An absolute dream, thank you so much Aspic for the best birthday! We went on to the Moulin Rouge afterwards, which is only 5 minutes away in a taxi.

The space is intimate--probably holds about 30 guests--and has clean, simple lines. The only option is a pre-determined tasting menu, with the chef asking about any food allergies or dislikes when the reservation is secured. Our meal included 7 or 8 courses, with 3 of fish. The food was meticulously prepared and beautifully presented, but more importantly, many of the courses qualified as sublime. There were no misses. The price is beyond reasonable. They have an amazing selection of gins from France. We tried several G&Ts to start and loved the more floral one.

This place was perfect. Marco made us feel welcome from the moment we walked in the door. We got seated right before a large party came in, so there was a fun atmosphere as we enjoyed our food and wine (we got a small bottle of the red wine of the month, which was just the right size to share for two). We started with the bruschetta di buffala, which was drizzled with a delicious olive oil. We each got a pasta dish and both were delicious. After our meal, we decided to linger over dessert and coffee. The homemade tiramisu came in three flavors— cafe, pistachio, and Nutella. We had a pistachio and a Nutella and enjoyed them with espresso. Marco offered us a limoncello after we finished, which was a nice finale to a wonderful dinner. We would highly recommend that you get there early or make a reservation — the place was very busy. I think you could choose anything from the menu and have a wonderful meal.

We dined here for dinner on our first evening in Siem Reap. Unfortunately, the dish wrapped in bacon, the main course, was way overcooked. The meat was tough. Very tasty though. The juices were the most enjoyable part of the dining experience, oh, and the gluten-free coconut ice cream.  Overall, decent. Really bummed to have not had the outstanding experience that others had. Maybe we were just too early and the kitchen wasn't prepared. Bummer.

Although I did not stay at Le Lotus Blanc Hotel, I decided to book my Christmas dinner at the Damrak Steakhouse as I had a good experience at this hotel. When I was looking for the bar some days earlier a lady staff member accompanied me all the way to the other building to show me where the bar was. Since that time I made it my favorite stop for the happy hour. The steakhouse is not what we call a steakhouse in Europe. In Europe a steakhouse is a popular restaurant serving beef but here it’s a fine dining place with very attentive and friendly staff. Fantastic refined food and good wines and a beautiful decor. They certainly made my evening. No doubt that they serve their good ranking on TripAdvisor

We were excited and expectations where high. We had a set menu. As my daughter needs to eat gluten free (always a challenge here in Asia) we hoped for the best. It as great, really great. Things she couldn’t eat where taken out and there was Gluten-free bread.  The goose liver pate was great. Soft and tasteful. The lobster soup was light, the meat and fish cooked to perfection and deserts were a treat. This place can compete with the top restaurants in Europe (and I have been to many good places). According to my sister who lives in Siem Reap the best meal she had in town.  So if you want fine dining at top level. With real high quality food and service. This is the place to go.  Yes a bit more expensive but we all know quality has it price, and here it is worth it.

This restaurant has a nice garden atmosphere, complementing good food and positive staff.  The spring rolls I had were very tasty.  The only thing I'd note about this place is that the menu is quite limited. They focus on spring rolls, and I tried the ones I most wanted to try. So, less chance of a return visit than other places.  Reccomended.

Loved the tongue and cheek menu. Delightful cocktail names and the token option of chips. If you are worried about only having spring rolls as a food option ... Then think again! There are so many different options ... Cover the table, share and tuck in! We had ours with a jug of Pimm's ... Which was delightful! On top of this their sustainability and ethics are great! They support their staff, local community and the planet (see photos for a snippet). Highly recommended!

What a gem of a restaurant!! Lorraine and Rennaud were the loveliest and most kind owners! Rennaud clearly explained their menu and you could see the passion and love put into each item. It’s a great set up- there are lots of options, you can get fresh or fried. Be sure to order the beef and carmelized onion (drool worthy) and the taco one as well! Both had fabulous flavours and weren’t overly greasy or doughy. The fresh roll we opted for were mama Mia and the Greek getaway. Again both were fantastic- my husband said he’d return to Cambodia just to come back to Wild- that says something! Lastly, the hubby had the chocolate spring rolls. He said they were a grea treat. Take lorraines advice on how to eat them- they’re messy!! In addition to the fabulous food, we paired it with a jug of the refreshing Tamara beverage. One word...YUM! Beyond the food, the service was perfect- staff were very knowledgeable and the venue itself had a great ambiance. We loved the relaxed feel with the tropical vibe. Would return again!

This place knows what it is - an Instagram dream - and they really work it. We arrived just as there were opening at 5 on the dot so were the first in. We watched and within 30 minutes the place was full of tourists like us - people couldn't walk past without being drawn in the front gates. They have a gorgeous garden which has been decorated with fairy lights and which has pallet tables where you feel like you are sat on the lawn. There is a tree house where they supply you with notepaper and pen so you can order and pass it down to the staff. There is the beautiful swinging egg chair and the Instagrammable wall mural.  Most places like this are all style and no substance. Wild however is both!  Their unique concept menu only has a few items of finger foods on offer - a selection of fresh or fried spring rolls and some sides. Each spring roll set comes come with a different dipping sauce to accompany them which enhances the flavours perfectly. The portions are quite generous, you only need order 2 sets of 3 for $3 each per person. I am a veggie and there were plenty of options for me which is always great. My husband is a meat eater and loved his choices too. The food was exceptional - you can really tell they thought about each item on the menu and made sure the flavours balanced and it tasted good.  Same story with the cocktails! Imaginative and tasty.  The French owners have done a fabulous job with everything from the decor to the food and the service. Couldn't fault our visit and can see why this place is so highly rated on Tripadvisor!

Two portions of different rolls each plus a bowl of hummus provided a very good meal. Nice rose wine according to my wife was much appreciated after a busy day site seeing. It seems the hosts were the owners and made an effort to ensure all were having a good experience. Last orders 9,30 pm and it is advisable to book.

Along with the traditional fillings they also offer a wide variety of savoury and sweet ones not to mention that their cocktails are amazing! The restaurant itself is a gorgeous place to spend time. The owners have kept the number of tables low for the amount of space they have and the result is well worth it. Be aware if you want to visit on the weekends however, this place is extremely popular and is usually fully booked! I would recommend WILD to anyone looking for a relaxed atmosphere and delicious food.

Although there was a sign at the entrance which said they were at full capacity, with a couple of recommendations of places to eat near buy (we love this ""support your neighbour concept btw"") we thought we'd try our luck anyway. Luckily, a couple was just leaving and the lovely host sat us down straight away. WILD specialises in fresh and fried spring rolls and they were delicious! We washed it down with a jug of their (just as delicious) cocktail. We recommend the TAMARA - lemongrass infused gin with pomegranite liquor, lime and ginger ale. The service was welcoming, friendly and attentive. Loved it!"

They don’t do dinner as such but have many different types of spring rolls. So, it’s like tapas. We ordered 5 lots of different spring rolls between the 2 of us and found that to be enough for dinner. We also tried 3 different cocktails, all of which were good. The garden setting is really lovely and I can’t wait to visit again.

A “training” restaurant that excels in service, food quality, and atmosphere more than most professional restaurants. We had an incredible experience here and enjoyed our khmer curries a lot.

After our first visit I was determined to go again because not only was our meal delicious but I felt we were supporting such a great cause. It was totally moving to see some of the more experienced staff literally ‘teaching’ some of the newer members of the team how to serve; open wine; take an order etc. The atmosphere was outstanding too and Sara was on duty one night and Paul the other night so we had the opportunity to speak to both of them. What impressive people and what amazing opportunities they are giving young people in Cambodia. We were so impressed. We also loved the food especially the red Khmer curry and the satay. Speaking to Sara moved us greatly as she explained how Haven came to be. We are both teachers so really could see and understand the fundamental change Haven was offering these lovely young people. Thank you so much Haven for being there and so glad we could be a small part of it,

Their mission is to train disadvantaged youth to work in the hospitality industry. They have a 16 month training program and support these youth throughout. Our servers were a mix of newer and experienced people. Everyone truly cared that you enjoy what you have, and the atmosphere. We had some outstanding food, including a tofu sate (the peanut sauce was to die for), the pumpkin soup (creamy and rich), the fish with mango salad and bananas in coconut milk (yum!). We ate in the courtyard which was quite charming. Reasonable prices. 5 stars!!

The food is over the top good. “That’s the best chicken satay I’ve ever had.” “The schnitzel is awesome,” and we’ve lived in Germany. “The curry is frickin great, why cant they have a ‘all you can eat menu?’” OK. That wasn’t actually said but I did think it. The deserts were awesome as well. And what the owners/directors are doing for young Cambodians is worthy of your patronage and a healthy tip.

They take in disadvantaged youth - train them in life skills, work skills, hospitality management - being servers, cooks , chefs , managers etc. Then trainees are sent out to other hotels for internships and then after graduation they all find jobs in the local Siem Reap hospitality industry. A remarkable process. Train your staff well and they will look after your customers.

Twice!	My partner visited six years ago and raved about Haven, a place with such good food, family staff feel, and Western management, that he took me with him on our visit to Siem Reap. We returned two days later to try more yummy menu items and were sad to leave! Khmer Amok Vegan and Pumpkin burger were our favorites. Local ice coffee and passion fruit spritzer were divine, and served with metal straws, a small detail we appreciated. Paul and Sara were amazing hosts, one on each visit, and were willing to answer all our questions about their Swiss foundation that does amazing practical charity work, in the Swiss-German apprenticeship style. The staff were all extremely helpful and well trained (better than most service we have elsewhere!). Prices are reasonable. Location is tucked away in quiet street a ten minute walk from the Made in Cambodia market. The garden and indoor seating areas were both charming. Thanks again, Paul and Sara, and hopefully see you sooner than six years (in the same location!).

If you're wondering where to dine while in Siem Reap, look no further and secure your reservation as soon as possible. We were so fortunate to have secured a table. Seriously, we speak so highly of this restaurant, even compared to the Embassy.  We had the fresh spring rolls and the pomelo salad, the outstanding beef loc lac, fish soup, and chicken Khmer curry. We had three traditional Cambodian desserts. The loc lac was amazing! Amazing! The Khmer curry was the absolute best of all the places we dined at in Siem Reap. Honestly and truthfully, so amazing. As a matter of fact, while we were fine dining at the Embassy, we were contemplating heading over to Haven after to scoop up a heartier meal. The desserts were delicious and like written online, were not sweet, swimming in coconut milk, and served hot. Everything was a winner and the chef was able to make the fried calamari gluten-free as well.  Danke Schoen for the best meal. So looking forward to dining at Haven on our next visit.  Notes: al fresco dining and not a mosquito in sight.  $65 USD

The prices were slightly higher than other places but the ethos is good. I’m not sure if it’s better than the rest as all the food and restaurants we have been to offer great value and similar food.

I would return to Sambo without hesitation once I am back to Siem Reap.  the 8.20pm group from table 10. :)

A small restaurant so charming, the boss is so lovely, and the quality of the food is ""exceptional"". A perfect balance of flavors and spices (I took the curry Massamane and my wife the vegetarian rice in a half pineapple ... we touched the paradise !). And the fresh juice for kids were so good ... all this quality for modest prices. SAMBO Khmer & Thai restaurant is an essential restaurant in Siem Reap, just go and test ! Be careful when you try to find the restaurant with PassApp application there is another Sambo restaurant that not exist. The good adress is just close to the night market."

This is not a fancy restaurant, but it’s quiet clean and remarkably good value for the quality of food they serve. Come here for a taste of authentic Thai food in this lovely city and you will be hooked. Please note that you should book ahead as it’s very popular, I had to go without on my second visit as it was full and reservations later that eve as well. The kitchen is small so the food will take its time to be served, but it’s a cool and comfortable place to wait over a beer or a glass of wine.

Good also to note that celebrities such as David Beckham have dined there in the past. Well worth a visit.

Feedback does suggest though that I am in the minority. Enjoy......

We visited this restaurant for dinner and after reading the good reviews, our expectations were raised. We found it lacking in atmosphere, despite the attentive service by the staff. Wine was expensive for what it was and the food was mediocre. My starter of prawns and calamari was not particularly inspired and my beef skewers, despite being tasty, just didn't hit the mark. My wife started with an aubergine salad that was doused in dressing and far too much fish sauce and her chicken main course was OK but nothing special. We wouldn't return.

The Sohhhak River is actually two restaurants, both of which have the same Khmer menu. The one next door is called the Charnery Tree and only serves the Khmer version. Sokkhak River, however, also has a French Fusion menu as well as tables inside with air conditioning, whereas Chanery Tree only has tables outside. As it wax another hot day in Siem Reap I opted to eat insid.  The French menu is really a Western menu offering mostly steaks, seafood and pasta main dishes for around $20-25. The Khmer menu is about half that price and looked much more interesting offering local classics like Amok, Lok Lak as well as the temptingly exotic Grilled Stuffed Frog, but as I was feeling less adventurous I opted for the Tonle Sap Steamed Fish ($11.50); Bar fish fillet with garlic, shallot, basil, spring onion, cashew and lime dressing. To drink with lunch I ordered a glass of the Obikwa Chardonnay from South Africa. Like all the red and white wines by the glass this cost $5.80.  The Chardy was nice - quite a lot of body with pear flavours. An easy drinking cheap and cheerful! The Sokkhak is very comfortable and stylish. There are two red and black display cases filled with small potted tropical plants, statues and other knick knacks that subtly divide the space in two, black tiled floors, contemporary local art on the walls, and dark wood sideboards where the settings are kept. I had a table near one of the windows that looked out onto a narrow breezeway filled with ferns that separated the restaurant from its sister property next door.  My main was delivered quickly and was very good. The fish was tasty and soft, and the sauce tart and flavoursome but not so much as to over power the main ingredient. The cashews added a nice crunch to an otherwise soft-mouthed dish. I think I did a good job matching the wine too as this complemented the dish very well.  I'd had the tasting menu at another high end restart just next door called Malis a couple of nights before which I really liked, but a couple of locals said this place was better. Personally I liked them both, but it's hard to compare the diverse tastes and experience of a degustation against a single dish. However based on the one I tried here today I'd have to call it a tie. I'd really like Chanery Tree/Sokkhak to introduce a tasting plate to their menu as there were a lot of things they do that I'd really like to try - starting, of course, with the stuffed frog

I booked a table online 1.5 days in advance and the one nice table, in front, outside which I asked for, when walking in, the waiter told me that there was a bad smell at this table and I should either sit inside or out the back, which is not nearly as nice as the seats out front. At one stage we were told that our main dishes would be out in 3 minutes... They arrived 15 minutes later. I ordered the chicken with spicy basil and asked them to cook the dish extra spicy. What they did is cook the dish as usual and put a spoon full of fresh, chopped chillies on top of the dish, why would a good cook do something so minimalistic? They offer no complementary water... many other restaurants do, you can order a 1.5 liter bottle of local water (not carbonated) for $4.50 which is outrageous for Cambodia.

He suggested that I make reservations, which I was able to do online the day before and they sent me an email confirmation right away.  When we got there about five minutes before our reservation we were greeted by the hostess as we walked up and she knew exactly who we were and seated us promptly on their upstairs air conditioned dining room.  We were attended to right away and seated in a quiet corner of the restaurant. The dining area, table, and the flatware were all immaculate. The menu looked great! We ordered an alcoholic drink and a mocktail, both of which were delicious. The food we ordered, traditional Khmer fare, was tasty. The tables next to us look like they were enjoying their meals too. Constant attention was paid to our table to ensure our water glasses stayed filled and that unnecessary plates were cleared promptly.  Rice was a la carte.  The only very minor issue I had was that the constant movement of the service staff through the sliding door caused the air conditioned room to become warmer as the night wore on. But that small criticism is the only blemish on a beautiful dinner at Chanrey Tree. Highly recommended.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn’t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn’t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they’d bring it over. Perhaps they didn’t see me come in but my first impression wasn’t that good. I know it’s not a big thing but nevertheless it’s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I’m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren’t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I’m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn’t written on the menu so I didn’t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn’t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn’t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I’m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.  The points above wouldn’t stop me from visiting again but there’s room for improvement.

The food is great (I am vegan and they do have a vegan brunch, or a smoothie bowl) ) and the staff very pleasant and helpful.  If you are into the pastry/sweet cakes there is a lot of choice and everything is made fresh on the premises.  They also often have freshly made jam and peanut butter - certainly worth buying to take with you.  You can also order bread (the day before) which is freshly baked on the premises - and its healthy as well!  Bayon Pastry School is a training facility for girls/women who would otherwise struggle to get a reasonable job. Here they are taught the fine art of making pastries, cakes etc. and then have a great start to getting a decent paying job at the end of their 12 months training.

If you dine here prepare yourself for a wonderfully relaxed and delicious dining experience which will transport you away from the hustle of the city.

We chose the set Menu ($45 pax) and paired it with the premium wine suggestions ($29pax). Each course is presented beautifully, explained and matched with a delicious wine selection. There was no rushing to push you onto the next course which added to the calm atmosphere. The food was nothing short of excellent! We have been lucky enough to dine at some fine Michelin starred restaurants and the food here was definitely on a par and in some respects exceeded. At this point I would like to directly say to Michelin .... You need to get out here and recognise the amazing work and culinary experience these 2 young chefs and their team are offering!

Without a doubt, the BEST meal in our 5-day trip to Siem Reap. The restaurant serves a 6-course set meal (no a la carte) and the menu changes monthly. We loved every single course, except for 1 of the main course (of pork, which was a bit dry). But every other course was amazing - full of delicious flavours, fresh ingredients and always a refreshing take on traditional Khmer cuisine, infused with modern cooking techniques. My favourite was the dessert - a fusion of western and Asian flavours - ice cream, and traditional cakes from Asia.  The restaurant is also beautifully furnished and the wait staff were attentive and responsive. At the end of our meal, one of the chefs came out to meet us and was open to our feedback about the pork course. They also gave us a box of 2 macarons each, which were really delicious (note that i'm really particular about macarons).  Overall, a most wonderful dining experience in Siem Reap.

We are fortunate to have eaten some excellent meals on five continents but this restaurant served us one of top five meals of all time.  The restaurant is staffed throughout by females and, without wishing to sound sexist, I truly believe you can taste and experience their delicate and feminine touch throughout.  My wife and I were privileged to enjoy their seven course, regularly changing, tasting menu and were rewarded with some exceptional, exquisite tastes. Presentation and service were exemplary too.  Combined with a four glass classic wine pairing for me and a four cup tea tasting for my wife, the cost isn't cheap in Siem Reap terms but at $36 per person for food, $29 for four glass of paired wine or $15 for four deliciously flavoured teas, it's incredible value for money given the quality of food, presentation and service on offer.  In addition we were given complementary amuse bouche to start, had opportunity to thank one of the chefs direct and were given a leaving gift of their exquisitely presented, complementary macaroons.  An exceptional experience that I would repeat in a heartbeat, I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly.  Do not miss.

The two waitress at the front said that they can only accommodate 2 person and not 7. While we were thinking to go somewhere else our other family member arrived ................. and all of a sudden they were able to arrange for us a large table for 7 people. I am still thinking it is a bit odd the way the staff handled customers. We enjoyed the set menu with wine pairing. The food are well presented and delicious. The serving are nicely paced, so we could talk in between the meals and enjoying the wine. I would have rated 5 stars, because of the muck up at the beginning to say only can accomodate 2 persons, decided to only give 3 stars.

There is no shortage of wonderful places to eat when you are visiting this city. But be sure to include this one in your list.  The meal is done as a set menu - everyone gets the same dinner (excepting allergies). So it makes it simple, with no choices to make. The toughest decision is whether to have the wine pairing (4 glasses), or not. Have it.  The 7-course meal is presented slowly, and beautifully. It takes about 2 to 3 hours to get though dinner, and each course is fairly small. So although it may sound like 7 dishes is a lot, it feels perfect.  The restaurant, operated by the Kimsan Twins (I don't think they are actually twins), is entirely staffed by women. The kitchen, clearly visible from the first floor dining room, shows the skilled chefs at work, and provides a show to watch between courses.  The set menu changes seasonally, but I suspect that every season is a winner.  Eat here.

We had been taken, by our guide, to lunches with Cambodian food. It was explained that these were standard Cambodian dishes. Perhaps these meals were a bit better than most Cambodians could expect to eat at home but we are experienced at eating in South-East Asia and could tell that we had local ingredients and a style that was different from neighbouring countries. With this background we were keen to go further and try fine dining. This restaurant was very good indeed. We chose the tasting menu for the month, in this case March, with the suggested wines. The style was Cambodian with immense care and effort taken with detail and combinations. How many different flavours may be presented without a clash? Well quite a lot! The wines from various countries were just right; for example with the, undoubtedly, free range chicken we were given a light red (Sangiovese). Later a sweet Gascon white was similarly well matched. This restaurant stands comparison with two star Michelin listed restaurants that we have been to. We were pleased to pass this opinion on to the very knowledgeable Executive Chef when she called at our table. The staff were impeccable, appropriately attentive and obliging. The one disadvantage was that the menu lasts for the month. Had we gone back next day it would have been the same.

Free Wi-fi excellent service food was absolutely beautiful and plenty of it, I went for the meat platter for one and the wife decided on chicken skewers, Although we where going to place everything in the middle with a bowl of hummus, Pitta bread and fresh lemonade for drinks. Have to admit everything was perfect, the accompaniments that went with it was also perfect, will certainly use this restaurant again when I’m wanting a change thanks to the chefs, and staff for the lovely service.

I think the waiters could see we were melting so when a table became free inside they asked us if we would like to move which was so thoughtful. We did and it was bless to be in the air-con. The menu is small and local but the food we had was really tasty and so cheap we could not believe it. We also had a couple of beers which were the cheapest we had anywhere. You cannot help be impressed with Tevy's story, (which you can read on posters in the restaurant), her survival and the loss of her family members is heartbreaking and now she helps young women have a better life by giving them work and training in her restaurant.  I would recommend this small and friendly little place for lovely and tasty local food and the price is a great bonus.

Did not get around to going until our last night which was a shame (don't make the same mistake) as the food here is quality at very low prices. It is only a small place and was full when we arrived. There was several groups waiting for space. Though this gave us the opportunity to chat to Cecil an Irishman who has assisted tevy in setting up this place and helping to run it. It was interesting to hear from Cecil about life in Cambodia. Anyway I digress the food and service our top notch go there and enjoy.

The food we took - noodles with shrimps and Cambodian lak lak - cannot be maybe considered as number one in Cambodia (that’s why I give only 4 out of 5) but it is definitely tasty and you need also to evaluate the entire experience. Starting from the welcoming, you feel really at home and it was very nice to talk with Tevy. The food is freshly prepared at the moment and you can really feel it that is homemade, like if you would be having lunch at your grandmother’s place. Portions are not huge, but all this came at a ridiculous price: 10$ including tips. Please, continue on this way! Give it a try, it is Tevy’s place but it can become also your place.

We had read the reviews and thought we must go. We got there about 7pm and were told by members of the queue that they were told they were the last to be served. Being British we ignored the warnings and joined the queues. Luckily they managed to squeeze us in and we had the best meal we had eaten in our two week trip. It was amazing value and we paid a chunk more than the bill came to as we felt that it was worth it. We even brought a few drinks to take back to the hotel with us. The spring rolls are fantastic. Also they were great for vegetarians as my husband is one. Just wished we had discovered this place on night one in Siem Reap as we'd have been back every night. Thank you to the staff and cooks at Tevy's Place.

However one dish (the chocolate dessert) although visually pleasing, sadly was one of the worst chocolate desserts we've put in our mouths. We all chose this dessert and all left it. The experience and all the other food was superb! It's worth a try if you're staying locally.

I emailed the restaurant and requested a table in the air conditioned dining area. Mr. Darin Eang promptly replied to my email and arranged for a quiet table. Service was excellent and the food was delicious. Three diners chose to share Kroya’s version of local Angkor dishes while our 2 gentlemen opted for hamburgers.

Escorted from our hotel across the road to the entry path where we were greeted by a waiter from the restaurant. We decided to dine inside and not brave the external hammock style arrangement. Dining area somewhat sterile and lacking atmosphere although there is high quality decor throughout. Service a bit tawdry, took a while for drinks to be served, wines and a beer. Kitchen somewhat slow with meals but meal quality and presentation was excellent. I would consider the restaurant a fine dining experience with matching prices and will give an ""excellent"" rating based on the quality of the meals."

The staff were wonderfully subtle in their service, the menu just big enough to allow everyone their choice and the food was fresh, very well presented and extremely tasty.  This restaurant would not be out of place is any European city as an Asian cuisine restaurant .  There is also a reasonable good choice of wines and cocktails for those who want it .  The prices were a little more than we paid for the previous night's local dinner but no where near what you would pay for that quality of food anywhere else .   Thank you for a really lovely evening

We enjoyed their 6-course tasting menu which we were told changes frequently. Staff were friendly and professional matching the nicely designed place.  Starters were a traditional Cambodian mango sallad with the twist of dried snake. This was followed by a deep fried pork stuffed sticky rice cake served with a fish ceviche dip. Both dishes were traditional yet modern. Precise and fresh flavours.  Main course comprised three dishes: lemon grass spiced fish with a tofu-ginger sauce, a papaya-basil-shrimp soup and curry-peanut fried beef tenderloin. All stretched the flavours in their own way. Together they formed a united, well composed dish.  It all finished with a raspberry sorbet, a sticky rice and sesame seed roll and coconut sago soup. Balanced and tasty.  Only drawback is the lack of a wine pairing meny. So we grabbed all their eight wine-by-the-glass and enjoyed our wine pairing ourselves.  If you are looking for a modern khmer restaurant in a modern and comfortable atmosphere, pick Kroya.

Food in Siem Reap can be very inexpensive, but with the low price comes a lack of quality produce and originality. Kroya is special. We first went because we were a little tired after arriving and it was easy. The 7 course Khmer tasting menu changes every night so no chance of getting bored with the food. There is an ""normal"" menu as well if you don't feel adventurous.  We had the tasting menu and enjoyed it very much. At $31 per head, it is great value. Wine is available at various price levels.We though the courses came out a little fast, but that is often the case in Asia, The size of the tasting plates was just right. I would comment that the wine was not quite chilled enough, but some time in the bucket solved that. Not a big problem.  Service was very friendly and fast enough, We ended up going more than once to avoid tourist food."

The swing seating is also quite an eye opener - Elegant, playful, brings a real element of 'occasion' to dining there.  Things started well, but a lack of detail started to emerge once the dining service got under way. The bottle of white wine we ordered was cool not cold upon opening and wasn't at it's proper temperature from the cooler until the last glass; My dining companion ordered the $31 tasting menu whilst I went a la carte.  Their serving procedure was to serve half of the tasting menu dishes in one go, to link with my starter course, and then serve the other half of the tasting menu all in one go again when my main course was served. Never experienced this in our collective lives, and we've seen how it's done in Thai restaurants in Bkk with different orders so it isn't a particular regional practice to cram up tasting menu courses to match an a la carte one. My companion ended up sending some dishes back to hold, to allow her to finish one course without letting the other dishes get cold and of course to concentrate on one set of flavours at a time. Most disappointed.  To be fair, the food was decent, I enjoyed my courses - had a lovely tofu tempura for starters (it was a main from their vegetarian menu) and soft shell crab for mains. All really well made and seasoned. Oh, except the rice - Cold rice. In SE Asia, that's almost heresy.  Service was too variable for comfort - As well as the above, our servers would either swarm around, or disappear - getting the bill at the end required catching the eye of one waiter who Pointed to another one who nodded, who came by a few minutes later to ask what we wanted.  It was too strange, at such variance to our normal experience in SR (and even at the very same restaurant where I'd eaten lunch last year). What made it go from a ""let's chalk this up to bad chance"" to ""this really isn't acceptable"" was that dinner including modest wine, and service ended up at $110 - By far the most we'd paid for food in SR, including at the fabulous Cuisine Wat Damnak."

As it was full with indoor tables, the waitress led us to this lounge. I was puzzled for a while but quickly realized it is also owned by Chanrey Tree.  The lounge has a high end set up, good atmosphere and live music. Dishes were very nice and the price is surprisingly moderate. The service was extremely good. They even helped us to get Tuk Tuk after dinner when it was raining.

We had spring rolls which were really fresh and tasty and you could tell they had been made to order. The soup with red nets in it was also really delicious and very different. Not just a gimmick they really add a flavour to the soup. We were on the top level and you feel so far away from the madness of the surrounding town. A real treat for one of our first nights in Cambodia. The staff also got us a tuk tuk to get home as it was pouring with rain when we were ready to leave. Excellent service all round.

The service is first rate, the menu varied and the wine list both affordable and varied. I enjoyed the fish amok but a Cambodian dish I tried on my second visit was somewhat bland.The singing was unobtrusive and the female lead was particularly good. All in all, a great experience and a very pleasant ambience and much better than some nearby and better known venues. There is an alternative open air alternative on the roof.

Sokkhak River Lounge has all this and more. We visited the top floor ,it’s hard to describe and the photos don’t do it justice it’s just one of the nicest surroundings I have ever eaten in. This is matched by the food and staff. I don’t often give five stars but this deserves it. The only drawback is the stairs to reach it but it is worthwhile.

That unquestionably turned out to be the case.  With an attractive bar on the ground floor, a bar with live music on the first floor we opted for the restaurant on the top floor. It is difficult to fully describe this restaurant. With an abundance of plants, tall ceilings and a multitude of windows open it almost felt like being outside eating close to nature. The ambiance was almost tangible.  During the evening we were looked after by the excellent Ms Van who did everything to make our visit memorable. The cuisine was delicious with service to equal that. But then towards the end of our visit t became really special. The rain came down outside and being in that restaurant felt like being in a rain forest..except we were dry of course. A great end to a special evening.  For an atmospheric evening with excellent cuisine put Sokkhan River Lounge firmly on your Siem Reap programme.

Like may other Siem Reap establishment, this restaurant is already ahead of the game when it comes to ban the use of plastic straws (lemongrass straws are used instead!). The food was good, not the best I had in town but definitely good for a pleasant dinner in a wonderful environment.

The top floor is heavily planted with tropical plants which makes it feel like you are in an oasis away from the busy streets of Siem Reap.  The staff were all very friendly, taking the time to talk to us and ask about our visit to Cambodia. It was a nice way to end our trip to Siem Reap. I can say that everyone we met in Cambodia was extremely friendly.

Having read many good reviews about this place, I decided to give it a try. It wasn't very hard to find and I went in to hide from the heating sun. There weren't many people when I was there but soon, the place filled up a bit. The couple were very welcoming the moment I stepped foot into the place and gave me a glass of cool water before I even ordered. I asked for a recommendation and the lady boss recommended and mango and passionfruit ice. I asked if it will be too big a bowl for me so she explained that I could opt for the smaller portion at US$1 lesser so I took that. While waiting for the ice, I was admiring the wall and pillars in the shop, which hundreds, if not thousands, of travelers have left notes on. The place was cosy and clean and definitely good for a breather from the heat. The ice came and I fell in love with it even from the first mouthful. The ice is not just pure ice but has condensed milk in it and it was really fragrant. The passionfruit sauce wasn't sour but has a mixture of sweetness in it as well. Perfect! Enough said!

On 16th Feb this year we returned for a second visit and were met with the same high standards but this time there was barely a spare table to be had, fantastic. The staff coped really well with the level of demands placed upon them and if you understand that some of them were relatively inexperienced because of the basis on which the business operates then this was even more impressive. The lady manager for the night had only to keep a watching brief and scarcely intervene at all.  The food remains excellent - the fried beef with red ants is a must try. Coupled with great value for money and free pick up and drop off service it make it a first class choice. Don’t be put off by the fairly obscure location and the alleyways that the tuk tuk driver has to take to get you to the entrance, it is all worth it.

Free tuk-tuk to and from the restaurant, greeted by the warm welcome of young Cambodian waiters and chef, all undergoing their training at this gem of hospitality & warmth. The prices were very reasonable, including wines, and food exquisite.

The pickup service failure- they had to be reminded to pick us up after we had been waiting for 30 minutes- this is even after we had sent an email booking(not answered) plus a confirmation call from our hotel reception earlier in the day  Setting was nice and service was friendly - but hard to see who was learning and who was coaching - recently in Laos we went to one where they had T-shirts to show who did what  Unfortunately for the prices charged (high by Cambodian standards) they failed to deliver - especially the $10 prawns and red curry sauce - the 6 very small prawns were soft like crawfish (very disappointing), the red curry sauce was nice but we could of done with some more, red rice was also ok but to call this plate a main is a joke - 6 mouthfuls and it was all over!  We did like the complimentary spring rolls and the mango and sticky rice ($4) was a good rendition of an Asian classic.  We did have a bottle of Italian Pinot Grigio which was unexpectedly very dry and a nice bottle of French Chardonnay both of which were priced at around the $22 mark - not sure who was meant to be coaching the lovely young lady to get the cork out but together we got there in the end  Large Angkor beers around $4 each  Plus a small thing that’s annoying is not showing the fully inclusive prices........

We were the only diners which, when we had finished a quite superb meal, left me amazed at how this venue is not on everybody's radar.  Won't repeat the principles on which this restaurant runs - read it all on their website - but it is worth supporting on that basis alone. Add to this the fact that the food is of such high quality and the staff so keen to make sure you have an enjoyable meal it is a tragedy that the place is not heaving with people every night.  The menu is varied and offered our jaded western palettes the opportunity to try some really authentic local cuisine - I will never look at red ants the same way ! It is also super value for money.  So Mr Rotha, Miss Ling, Mr Orm and Mr Pist - keep up the good work for your bosses. Everybody else - just go there !

We were truly lucky to have such a wonderful restaurant at our disposal.  The tasting menu was great value and had some wonderful highlights such as the scallops on pumpkin purée; beef carpaccio with a delicious Khmer salad; lamb shank curry, to mention a few. The à la carte options were also lovely.  Breakfast each morning had a wide range at the buffet, and the made to order dishes were also delicious (loved the french toast!)  We also took a ‘Spice Spoons’ cooking course with the chef. This started with a visit to the town market (an experienced in itself!), followed by cooking several dishes under careful instruction. We were then able to savour these freshly made dishes over lunch (fresh spring rolls, hot/sour soup, chicken curry, banana sago). Water and soft drinks were also provided as was a usb with the recipes, and apron.  Staff were wonderful, very attentive and friendly throughout our whole stay.  The location is a little out of town, but certainly worth a visit if you are not staying in the hotel!

You can get 2 courses for $12 or 3 courses for $15 including one glass of wine or a soft drink. I found out about the business lunch menu from other TA reviews.  Unfortunately, we couldn’t afford to visit Chi restaurant for tasting menus that they offer in the evening but this was perfect.  The manager Sarah even came to introduce herself during our meal.  I would definitely like to visit again with hubby.

We ordered the tasting menu but exchanged the mains and the deserts. Which was a mistake. The first courses of the tasting menu were fantastic, delicious and nicely presented. We loved the scallops and the carpaccio was absolutely delicious. Very disappointing were the mains. We exchanged the lamb to seabass and beef lok lak. Both were not really good and not nicely presented. We had the feeling we got food from a different restaurant. The desserts were o.k, but just too big. They had a great service and great drinks. Overall the tasting menu was really nice and absolutely recommendable. But you should stick to this if you are a real foodie.

The restaurant is located at Anatara Angkor Resort in Siem Reap where I was a guest for four nights with my family. The recommendation is to stay at Anantara to maximize this amazing restaurant.If you are not staying at Anantara I suggest you visit Chi at least once.The restaurant has everything one would want for a quiet family or romantic dinner. Great wine selection.Every dish from starter to dessert, a masterpiece. The signature dishes are to die for. The staff is very helpful and attentive. Since we were staying at the resort, we had an opportunity to have daily breakfast at Chi. There was a great buffet layout plus one can select signature dishes from a la carte menu which is included in the price of breakfast. It was so nice to see F&B manager Mr Sheldon talking to the guest making sure everything is good, we had a specific request for our main course and it was accommodated. Their prawn curry was just awesome and my daughter fell in love with their chicken Korage and salt pepper calamari. Every meal we were served was of the exceptional standard even at the room service. Their signature Crab cake is a must and if you have breakfast at Chi, order their signature waffles and eggs. (yummy). i highly recommend 'Chi'.Take it from a foodie!! 0

Each course was explained to us and we found the presentation and balance of flavours quite superb - we enjoyed every bite.This is a restaurant serving world-class food and we would highly recommend it, we cannot wait to return.

What I really appreciated as a vegetarian was that the veg options on the menu were equally fabulous and not an afterthought. Our student waitress Kim Ho was warm, attentive and spoke lovely English. After our meal, Sophy gave us a little information about the school and the numbers behind the program. If these are the results that this school can achieve within a 10 month training program then I'm incredibly impressed.  The school kindly allowed us to tour the school which now includes a handful of chic spacious rooms available to rent during your stay in Siem Reap. We know where we're staying next time! Also - they have a beauty salon which offers treatments (book the day before, see their website) which I didn't try but the treatment room looks lovely and very professional.  Highly recommended!

We love Sala Bai so much that I made our first reservation from Australia before we left and we went there for lunch only hours after landing back in Siem Reap. We were not disappointed! We were greeted and seated in a most professional way, and the staff were lovely and friendly as always. Now for the best part - THE FOOD! I had the raw fish salad for my entrée and it was so unbelievably delicious that we went back numerous times and I always ordered the same entrée. My husband fell in love with the prawn Caesar salad, which is huge for an entrée. We tried something different every time for a main and everything we tried was just beautiful. The service staff are very attentive and the prices are very reasonable. All money goes towards their training program, which has a 100% success rate of placing graduates. Located only a couple of minutes out of town by tuk tuk ($6 for a return trip is heaps), it is well worth it. The restaurant area is located in the upstairs part of the building and it is lovely and cool. I can not praise Sala Bai, it's food and it's staff enough. Do yourself a favour and visit. You'll keep going back, I promise you!!

Large groups should book ahead . We were able to walk in at lunch but was still busy so best to book ahead.

One of those places in my wishlist for Siem Reap. The students cum trainee waitresses gave me a warm welcome. Felt good about it. Had lunch here, which I had Grilled Beef & Lemongrass Salad and drank Sala Bai Passion Breeze. The food kind of contemporary and the drink was so refreshing. Many food photos actually uploaded here and other blogs were obsolete cos they change the menu from time to time. The price is very reasonable considering they put effort to make your food looks presentable. Must try places.

I returned last week to Sala Bai for lunch and I chose to review anew to confirm the very positive first impressions. The welcome, the sweet attentive service supervised by pro teachers and the quality of the food served are impressive, even more so considering both kitchen and service is manned by young students. This small school is impressively committed to fighting poverty and human trafficking via vocational training. Sala Bai enrolls only the most disfavored Cambodian youths and provides a year long hospitality training (plus housing, food, clothing, health care etc) absolutely free of charge. All students (70% young ladies, the most exposed) are then employed by upscale hotels in Siem Reap. This has broken the evil circle of poverty for now thousands of families. I lift my hat to this achievement and encourage you to book a lunch! Thank you.

I cannot believe that this tiny training facility reataurant is not booked out for every weekday for breakast and lunch. Every meal is cooked and served by the sudents learning hospitality skills for free under the guidance of a dedicated team lead by a French NGO. If you go for brekky at 8 am you will be fortunate to see these proud young Cambodians from the poorest of circumstances go through their morning briefing and lessons and enjoy a chance to meet the staff. Inspirational dining! By eating here or staying upstairs in their weekday training hotel you support these youths to move to a bigger and better facility next year and to positively change their lives. AN ABSOLUTE MUST VISIT!!! And I havent even begun to describe the excellent food at incredibly cheap prices!

We had a very good lunch, wholesome and delicious, the attendant students were understandably a little nervous but nonetheless served us well and with great charm. Spare an hour or so to visit if you can, read the website first and not only will you enjoy the food but also learn more about the school and its aims.

Book a lunch at Sala Bai! A hospitality old timer, the little Siem Reap Sala Bai Hotel School has captured my heart & soul through its commitment, tuition quality, consistency, humanity and performance. Check their website as SB closes 2-3 months in summer before greeting new students. Returning as often as possible I know them now a bit. The lunch (part of practical training) is always good and of very good value and quality. Choice of well composed Khmer or Western light set menus; I have never been disappointed. The fully inexperienced Khmer youngsters come straight from the absolutely most disfavored rural communities and show extraordinary will and pride in learning. You'd be amazed at what they can perform after a couple of initial training months - starting from literally nothing at all in terms of hospitality & what foreign or Local guests might expect. Photos from I accompanied SB social worker on very! rural field family visits. I congratulate all active and involved. And I recommend you to book a little ahead. Enjoy!

We read the brochure and appreciated the process more and we were more comfortable with a long wait but once the food came it was very well presented and tasty. We had this incorporated into our 7 day tour and it was a big draw card for choosing this type of tour. We had the set lunch menu and the fish which was goby madrone in an amok style was served with a refreshing salad. We had interesting drink shakes beforehand. The organiser of the school came for a showery chat with us which was pleasant and not pushy.

We had three courses and were full but not struggling to finish.  There is a good range of drinks to accompany the meal and the coffee is excellent, which was a pleasant surprise throughout SR, on our first trip here. This is a training school and we were near the end of their year, which could affect quality at other times but we honestly could not fault it.

We were delighted to took his suggestion. We relaxed and lounged over a 75 minute multi-course lunch which amounted to $7 per person if I remember correctly. The food was excellent, the crowd pleasant, the service attentive, and the atmosphere simple yet cute. A summary of our experience is bulleted below:  KEY COMMENTS  - Excellent food!  - Market pricing relative to other comparable options (although I think it's a better deal when you figure in the large size of the set lunch compared to other lunch options out there)  - Attentive service. Look is we had spent $50 per head and a uber fancy restaurant then my opinion in this case would be different. But the students were extremely attentive (albeit a bit inexperienced as you should fully expect).  - Cute yet very simple restaurant that is part patio and part open air inside of house. All ground floor. Very simple yet cute. It was a little warm but that was to be expected on a hot humid day in May.  - Largely an expat crowd which was amiable and appeared to be regulars for the most part. I really like places that are heavily frequented by regulars. And Sala Bai is definately enjoying support from the local expat crowd which is a both necessary and great.  - Great cause. I love love love what this restaurant and training school is doing. There are some other good ones in town but this one has a very boutique and personal touch to it!

The location is about 12mins walk from pub street. However, if you're not familiar from the place, be sure to ask for directions every now and then. Most guests take a tuktuk or hire a private van. I suggest the management should post a road sign at the corner of dela paix and taphoul street so it would be easier for people to locate it.  On the lighter note, the food was worth the trip. The beef salad and amok fish is by far the best I had tasted in Cambodia. The beef steak w/ potato was good but the beef is not tender and hard to slice (they didn't provide steak knife). The seafood w/ rice is too salty.  The server overlooked one of our orders in which we followed up after almost half hour. The manager was apologetic afterwards.  The French lady (communication manager?) approached us and all the other guests.  Overall, this trip is indeed a meal for a cause.

They overlooked one of our orders, and we waited for almost 30 minutes for it to be served, we followed it up and it was really overlooked. the manager was apologetic but it's really no big deal.  A French lady approached us and said she's the communication manager (?) for sala bai. She asked if the food was good and to post our comments on trip advisor.  Food was good, service is 4/5. After all, this is a training school. We came here for the good food and the server still has a lot of training to go through.  A little suggestion: I hope they would put a road sign at the corner of dela paix and Phum tapoul street so tourists who prefer to walk would find it easier.

It was interesting to watch the trainee staff learning on the job.  If you wish to tip them, do so at a box at the entrance of the restaurant - when we visited, they were raising money to go on a class trip together during their vacation.

The school is run by the students and they do a very good job.

If we'd gone earlier we would have eaten here alot.  The restaurant and guesthouse provides comprehensive training to 100 Khmers every year - 70% of them women and all of them from very disadvantaged backgrounds. 100% of graduates (that's more than 800 people to date) have been assisted to find jobs.  The service is the best you will find in Siem Reap and the food is exceptional. You have the choice of a two or three course set menu of western or Asian persuasion or a selection of a la carte dishes.  I can't recommend this restaurant more highly. It's such a great social project - but the food and service cannot be faulted - so it's a win win choice.

We were given complimentary bread with butter and bruschetta, which was excellent. I ordered the fried rice with chicken, which was the best either of us had tasted anywhere. My fiance ordered the deep fried chicken with wedges. The chicken was a little dry, but once dipped into the tartar sauce that was provided it was quite nice. All money goes towards the staff, who all come from disadvantaged backgrounds, and the organisation has so far been able to place 100% of graduates into full time work within 3 months of graduating from here. Well worth the visit!

I would like to visit again, it’s just a shame it’s not open later on in the evening.

The favorite was actually the vegetarian carrot and potato curry. The staff there was so friendly and nice. I also enjoyed the part about kids playing around right outside, they looked so happy. The money they earn at this restaurant goes for an education for the children but since the food and service was unbelievable good; the trip here made it really worth spending extra money on some souvenir stuff and donations. I’m amazed about this whole concept and experience. Keep up the good work you guys!

The young girl (sorry can't remember her name) gave us a lovely welcome and a summary of what the training restaurant is all about, as it teaches unemployed/uneducated Khmer students valuable cooking and hospitality skills. We had a set menu which made it so much easier not having to decide what to eat, we also had a mixture of beers, wines and cocktails all at very reasonable prices. The food was excellent and plentiful with excellent service. The evening was a pleasant experience for all of us, what a way to finish our holiday in a local setting. Thank you to all at the restaurant for a very memorable experience one we look back on fondly.

Its not near town, so you will need to grab a Tuk Tuk to take you there. The food is good but what makes this so memorable is the cause it supports- free education and healthcare for the local community. After our lunch we spent some time with children in their classes (this is optional ) and absolutely loved it. Would recommend it to anyone.

In fact, our lunches at New Hope were highlights of our culinary adventures in Siem Reap. Both traditional Cambodian food and westernized items are available on the varied menu--all are well prepared with great attention given to service and presentation. The various fruit shakes are awesome, and I was impressed with the quality of their gourmet coffee selections (and I am VERY picky in this area).  The system behind this NGO facility is most impressive. A large number of volunteers assist the school regularly, but at its core lie a dedicated staff of locals committed to developing Cambodia's youth. The more you learn about the cause, the more you will want to seek this incredible restaurant out. It is well worth the effort to get away from the usual tourist venues and make your way through the city's backroads to sample this restaurant's offerings and get to meet some truly remarkable people.

Reaching NEW HOPE is little bumpy but worth. For me it was a great experience to visit this place. Though I did not have any appointment I was greeted by Mr. Kemsour and he took time to show me what the NGO is doing to make life of poor people from rural areas.  I had lunch and some drink and both were great. There are possibilities to become a sponser of this NGO. The NGO helps those people who are really helpless. I witnessed distribution of rice and other basic groceries to poor people from rural areas. They do keep a watch on families that they do not misuse the donated things.  May God bless New Hope NGO.  By visiting this place you support the NGO!!

We took door #2.  Dinner was served in a nicely decorated room, with classic jazz playing in the background – Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk.  The Khmer Savory Menu looked like a great deal – 55 USD with wine parings.  First a tempura oyster with three sauces. Small, but it was supposed to be just a taste.  Next came two kinds of fish cakes, with three garnishes: one a pickled papaya and onion; a raw green papaya salad; and purple cabbage. Everything was arranged on top of three spicy sauces and diced tomatoes.  This was followed by a chicken soup served over a mix of steamed and fresh vegetables.  We were served a mango intermezzo; and then the entrees. I selected the wok stir fried beef and vegetables, and my wife ordered the river bar fish. We traded off and agreed they were both excellent.  The meal was accompanied by fresh baked baguettes and two kinds of flavored butter.  We finished with a warm tapioca pudding, with diced bananas and a spoon of coconut ice cream.  At the end of the evening we decided it had far exceeded our expectations for food quality, presentation, and value. The overall amount of food was fine, and all the wine parings were appropriate.  Service was attentive, but not intrusive; and the pace was perfect.

Don't miss it!	My husband and I recently had dinner at Damak Lounge on two occasions on our past trip to Siem Reap. It’s elegant and very tasteful. A hidden gem in Siem Reap! Perfect decor and a lovely staff. We’ve had dinner here in the past and it was awesome but some menu items have changed and it’s a “must do” if in Siem Reap. You won’t find this quality of dining anywhere else. Upon arrival you are guided by a host and taken by elevator to the second floor - the Privileged Floor by Lotus Blanc where Damak Lounge is located. My husband is on a special diet and they saw to his every need. Kanika our host made our first reservation while explaining all the amenities in the area. The restaurant has an extensive wine list as well as cocktails. I had champagne and it was heavenly. There’s no rush, couples and families at tables chatting and celebrating in a low tone. Extremely top shelf. Last year when we were there they had live music but this time a nice selection of soft music playing. I’m writing my review and wishing we were there now! One night we were pretty tired so we ordered and our meal was delivered to our room. It was perfect. If you want something that’s not on the menu, just tell them, and it will happen. Mr. Jacky suggested Damak Lounge along with a couple other places. But Damak Lounge was a home run! Don’t miss it!

Never easy to describe a solo experience....so let's be factual Done the booking from Sofitel and arrived around 8.30pm The restaurant is strangely located at the end of a hotel corridor with rooms... Once there 8 tables were occupied, all tables for 2 except a table of 5...half of them already finished their dinner. Hostess and waiters were friendly.... order a bottle of French Rosé.....arrived 25 mn later.. Order a starter to share (use even google to be sure of U 10 blue shrimps with the waiter) and 2 mains...starter never arrived. Oxtails soup was really good The duck was perfectly cook but for the rice it was totally the opposite. Staff again was friendly... but not focus...

Very very impressed. I live local so I will definitely visit again.

A absolutely adore the grilled chicken with the sweet potato and coconut milk mash, and the grilled rice balls/dumplings with chive. There are a lot of dishes for the more adventurous palate also, using local herbs and roots. All very very delicious indeed and very reasonably priced.

Once I went there, I ate there so many times, trying out various dishes in the menu, all innovative, all fusion Khmer with eye catching presentation . There are many restaurants in Siem Reap but POU has earned its distinctive star along with other gourmet restaurants like Malis and Khema. It is very vegetarian friendly. The menu harbours a limited number of extremely delicious items. I highly recommend this place. It is casual, near Wat Damnak and manager may be present at times as he manages the other POU, great to meet the CHEF who usually is at the other resto but i met him here. Hong is a wonderful server and she deserves credit for the service and people coming back to the pleasant kind khmer atmosphere

Tiny chopped green beans, lotus stalk and other vegetables that I was not familiar with. The serving was more than enough for one person.  We also had pork belly and egg noodles.

Try some of the very creative cocktails created using tradicional Cambodian stuff like local Whisky and palm sugar.

Pou Restaurant and Bar accomplishes this quite well! We joined to friends for dinner one evening, but had to sit at separate tables because they had reservations and we did not. Yes it is that small. We made reservations for the six of us for the following evening, and were accommodated on one of their two larger tables.  Both dining experiences were fantastic. The Khmer chicken was excellent both times our table tried it. Also, the ginger tapioca dessert is something I’m going to try to duplicate at home. The creative menu and the use of local leaves, herbs, and flowers, sets this restaurant above many of the great places we tried during our travels to Singapore, Thailand, and Cambodia during this trip.  Yes, the staff may be a little disorganized at times, the kitchen is on the second floor, and the staircase is quite steep. But there’s a lot of love in this kitchen, and a lot of love in the presentation of the food, and I don’t think there’s anything better you can ever say about a restaurant.

On entering the restaurant I had no idea what was behind the facade, which looks pretty ordinary, and said I wanted to eat inside. The waiter politely sugggested outside would be better and led me around the side of the building. I was really amazed, they have unique swing-mattress, bed like tables (though you can choose a normal table if you want) that make you feel like it is a high end restaurant in Marrakech (the last time I saw anything like this). So we were super comfortable and our toddler was in her element. The food was also great, the drinks wonderful and the prices, even with the 10% added at the end, crazy low given the ambience and environment. We will be back!

(they also provide indoor ac space) If it wouldn't have been for the somewhat ""dreamy"" service (no change available, not responsive, did not check on us later) I would have given 5 stars. Raw spring rolls are delicious, fried spring rolls a little bland, not the proper sweet-sour sauce served, no red ants available for the beef salad, fish amok was very good, small pieces of white fish."

We had the chicken spring rolls as a starter. A t-bone and a tenderloin as mains. And several margaritas.  The service is attentive and very friendly.  A bread plate is served which looks just like cut sliced bread but is in fact quite nice and we had a second helping.  The spring rolls were good and the accompanying sauce is not overly sweet as is often the case, but not here.  The t-bone was very nice. A bit of char and smoky flavour. It was ordered medium-rare and came slightly over but it was still heartily enjoyed.  The tenderloin was a much thicker cut and also ordered medium-rare. It came slightly under.  The presentation of the steaks and the condiments is excellent.  The margaritas were very good and generous with the tequila.  Coffees and more banter with the staff finished a very enjoyable night and our best meal in Siem Reap over three days.  The food for the price plus the service makes this place a winner. Slight variances in done-ness of the meat did not detract enough for us. We would return to this place anytime we are in Siem Reap.

Almost everything we ordered was good. Fried spring rolls, morning glory, amok were our all time favourites in almost all restaurants, and Try Me did not disappoint us on these. Portions of rice that came were huge. The lemon mint lemonade and Khmer pumpkin sago dessert was especially notable. For all 5 of us, the total bill came up to just $21 with drinks.  Both bathrooms ran out of water and had no water running from the taps. The WC flush still worked but not the taps at the basins. The staff filled up a pail with water for us to wash our hands instead. Apart from this, would recommend a visit.  If you are facing Caltex petrol kiosk (there is only one Caltex in Siem Reap), take the road on the left of Caltex. Keep going down this road and Try Me is there.

Made it a point to visit this place after reading all the reviews about it! I was there on a quiet night and opted to sit on the upper floor so that I could have a good view of the street. There was a great selection of Western and local cuisine on the menu. I had the local lok lak since I have not tried it yet and ordered a shake as well. The shake is very cheap, at only US$1 and it is soooooo goooood! Food is not expensive either. I did not regret stepping into this place and wanted to visit it again but did not have another opportunity since my trip was a short one. But will definitely visit again if I ever go back to Siem Reap! Highly recommended for anyone visiting Siem Reap!

If only I had more days there, I would definitely keep trying out their other dishes. Can't wait to eat here again when I come back to Siem Reap.

Also had a “fresh & tasty” cocktail which was superb and the Australian Chardonnay was also good  We ate early (6.30) so were the only ones there.  Service was great, with each dish explained by Nab the owner, and he introduced the two other staff on that night doing the cooking.  This is our 3rd visit to Siem Reap so we have eaten at a lot of places. Will definitely be going back to this one.

All in all a pleasant evening that will not break the bank.  TIP: ensure your Tuk Tuk drivers waits or comes back for you. There are no Tuk tuks that hang around the site after the show so you could get stuck.

The welcome and entrance to the restaurant created a great atmosphere and the setting is certainly beautiful.  But, the menu pricing seems designed to push you towards one of the set menus, with a couple available at each of a number of price points. Trying to building your own 3-course meal from the a la carte menu is considerably more expensive. So we went with the set menu and our meals were ok, but the portions were small and you can get better value for money elsewhere. The wine list is limited and very expensive.  The main reason for dining here though is the show, and that was very enjoyable (if a little brief). The thing is, once the show was finished (which was early in the evening) we got the sense that we were meant to leave, as the wait staff stopped attending to tables.  Before that though, we noticed how all of the wait staff, who were certainly very chatty and friendly, were putting a lot of pressure on the patrons to write a glowing Tripadvisor review, before they even left the restaurant! Our waitress was quite insistent that we write a review that mentioned her by name (which I won't do here as I don't want her to get into trouble).  Although we would recommend this restaurant as an option for a night out in Siem Reap, we also don't feel that it should be ranked as highly as it is.

We went for one of the set menus as it makes us eat dishes we would not ordinarily order. Most were fantastic. The rest were good.  The setting for the restaurant was lovely. Trees and a pond in front of the stage. The music and the dancing, provided at no extra charge was really pleasant and the be costumes bright and colourful. Made for a really pleasant evening. Bora was particularly attentive with good conversation between courses.  Can highly recommend. We will most likely come back before we leave in 3 days time.

I booked 'Art Shadow Restaurant' several weeks ago for a Friday night, knowing we would be in Siem Reap at that time. The response confirming my booking was quick and we arrived as arranged. We were allocated a nice table and enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant that is set in a nicely wooded area with atmospheric candles and lighting. Service was good and efficient, perhaps a little bit too much so. We ordered several glasses of wine before we ordered food and at 5 US dollars a glass, it was good value. My wife and I both ordered the same food, starting with a green mango and crispy fish salad, followed by Stir Fry vegetables in an Oyster sauce with rice. A pre-starter arrived which was pleasant enough. The starter was fresh, piquant and tasty. The stir fry vegetables of the main course arrived quickly after, perhaps a little too quickly, and were only luke-warm, as was the sticky rice giving me the impression it had been sat around waiting for us to finish our starter. However, it was tasty and the vegetables were a la dente as they should be. Whereas the food wasn't top notch, it was perfectly acceptable and for the price, good value when one considers that the traditional Cambodian music/dancing that takes place from 7.30pm until 8.30pm is included in the price. We both had an enjoyable evening which was perfect for our first night n Cambodia. The restaurant was almost full so created a good atmosphere. If in Siem Reap, Art Shadow restaurant is well worth considering for a good night out with reasonable food, good entertainment and warm service. We had a really enjoyable evening.

I loved mine and he liked his but wasn't completely blown away. I'd definitely recommend the satay. Very good value, just under $13 for x2 drinks and x2 mains.  We sat on the roof terrace and watched the sunset. Staff were super friendly and smiley and the service topped off the evening. The only very slight improvement is maybe take the empty plates away a bit sooner. I think it was out of the staff's politeness and they didn't want to interupt because just a quick glance over and you could catch their attention. Very attentive and I would recommend this restaurant.

The Christa is located south of the old market, in a relatively quiet neighborhood behind handcraft market.  I ordered fish amok, which the serving size and taste are satisfactory. The price, as expected, is also much cheaper which serves the purpose.  Decent choice if you stay around the area.

As I said it was Ok, not Oh Woo Hoo amazing like the other reviewed. Now that being said It was mid afternoon and I stopped for chicken satay as an appies and had a glass of red vine. The server showed me the bottle and I reviewed the label as I held the bottle. What I was served was a cold glass of wine. It either not what he showed me or an opened bottle that was in The fridge. Somewhat disappointing. The satay presentation was good - but the chicken was chewy and lacked a proper seasoning. The service was very good.

Even though there were plenty of tourist in the restaurant it felt more like a place that expats and locals eat. The Khmer food was wonderful and the prices couldn't be beat. We ate at several other restaurants in Siem Reap that were provided by our tour company but this one beat all of them hands down. It feels authentic and is less than half the price of the other restaurants in the tourist section of town. I would definitely eat here again if I was in Siem Reap, I suggest you give it a try.

We had papaya salad with prawn- finger leaking good, fish amok- fresh fish and no smell, tamarind fish curry- a nice salty-sour dish, noodle soup- a bit too ordinary but tasty. All served food looked fresh and well presented, western restaurant look and perhaps taste as well. However, i can't fault it :) Prices are very cheap as in comparison same dishes that don't taste as nice cost double around Pub Street-city centre (5 min walk). So it is certainly a good value and portions' size are good. Staff are very attentive, humble and happy :) This place is full of europeans and western people. Perhaps lacking a little of atmosphere/traditional music/cambodian decor. Nevertheless, 5 stars from me :)

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying ""ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.""  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."

We visited this restaurant during a recent city break because it was situated a few metres from our hotel. We were seated promptly and our order taken quickly. We opted for fish soup for starters. This was delicious, worth the visit alone. For main course we settled for grilled sea bass. The fillets were displayed conveniently in a cabinet in front of our table. The kitchen area was beside this and we were able to see our fish being cooked. The fillets were placed on the counter and calls for the waiting staff were made, but it took about 5 minutes from then for the plates to be delivered. The fish was nice in spite of this. In hindsight we probably should have served ourselves. Our desert was pistachio ice cream which was delicious. With wine and beer the bill came to a reasonable £47.00. Overall service was a bit slow after a good start.

The frutta di mare was good too but the shrimp were very small and probably were a frozen component.  Finished with a pistachio semifreddo, which was very good!

Betlemske square is a bit off the tourist trail, and away from the high traffic areas. Oliva Nera is a very attractive restaurant with some well set-up covered outside seating- ideal for a hot August night. Starters were competent, mains (we both had filled pasta dishes) were excellent, good pasta and excellent sauce. Service was attentive and quick- a little too quick- as 11.00 pm approached we felt rushed as the outside area was packed up around us. Closing time was much earlier than other places in Europe. Nevertheless it is a good restaurant. Get there early, though.

The menu looked great so we decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed. Service was great by all the wait staff, attentive to our entree orders, bread for the table, and warm blankets if we needed with an evening chill in the air. And, we appreciated the wine recommendations from George, that nicely complimented our meals. Five of us in our party with a variety of dishes we all enjoyed. Fresh ingredients, seasonings and cooked perfectly. We recommend.

We ordered local drinks such as the Staropramen Lezak tmavy and Radler beer which were very good in taste and had ordered home made desserts like the tiramisu and the torta al cioccolato con pistacchi. They were all delicious and we enjoyed our short stay as the weather was great. The staff was very helpful. the price tag of the goods were a bit on the high side but we still recommend this restaurant.

It is true that you get what you pay for. While this restaurant has prices that might be slightly higher than some other Italian restaurants here, the food is fabulous and it was one of the best meals I have had so far on this trip (I've been in Budapest, Vienna and now Prague). I ordered the meat ravioli in tomato sauce. It was very good, obviously homemade, and presented perfectly. Then, there was the pistachio semifreddo which was so yummy it makes you want to lick the plate! Our waiter (George) was attentive, friendly and so pleasant to chat with. We ate inside as the evening was a bit cool and seeing the light play off the Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the dining room was lovely. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a non-touristy place to eat which has a great menu selection. We are definitely going to go back before we leave Prague.

The food is great and if this review was based on food alone then this would be 5*. I have to dock 1 * for the speed of service. You get forgotten whilst staff are having a cigarette break or talking to one another in the central courtyard. We had a long wait for a drink and a long wait when we had asked for the bill. The setting is not great but a wonderful meal none the less and would consider eating there again - I could probably overlook the speed of service for the quality of food you get. Pricing is reasonable and you get good portions.

This was our first dinner in Prague for the 4 of us and it was the perfect first night out!  When you walk-in the restaurant it may originally appear to be a little underwhelming but I can assure you that you are in for a special evening! First you need to make a reservation as there are very few seats. In fact we made our reservation more than 30 days in advance. With Peter and Martin as both our hosts and Chef for the evening we were treated to an array of great starter courses and later on some nice main courses as well - but make no mistake this is true family Italian. We also tried several fine Italian wines all by the glass and all were very good and quite reasonable. Between the four of us we must have enjoyed 10 glasses of wine, 8 different starters, 4 different mains, a dessert, and 4 glasses of grappa all for about $35 US per person.  But not only was the food terrific and all prepared right in front of you - the interaction with the owners Peter and Martin was just as much fun!  This is a can’t miss restaurant in Prague and one of the first reservations for dinner I would make when planning my trip!

Let’s start with the food, because it might be the smaller part of the story. It is fresh, good ingredients, well prepared but if you are looking for a culinary experience it may not hit an elevated state.  The experience pushed it over the top. The restaurant is in something like a 4m x 7m room including kitchen and dishwasher. There are two staff one cooking and one engaging patrons. The wine list is a superb collection of wines from Puglia which happen to be our palate (those accustomed to California or Australian wines may be challenged) and we’ll paired by the server guy. This was the friendliest place we ate at, and humour was always present and appreciated. The size of the place also made conversations with other patrons easy, adding to the charm.

Great ambiance in a small place, reservations are required as they only have 12 seats. They offer 2 hour seatings beginning at 5 pm and it was full. They should put a sign on the door saying full as the staff had to constantly turn away people.  Quite a few small plates to choose from with an ample list of wines to pair with them.  We had the garlic shrimp, Italian meatballs, salmon in crispy Philo and the potatoes with bacon and cheese. Good flavors, but shrimp and salmon were way over cooked, shrimp could have been a frozen product.  The place feels like a small gathering of friends for wine and appetizers so it's a great concept and the personal service is very good, but our food experience led us to feel that it is possibly overrated.

They had a nice selection of wines, but the waiter never bothered recommending us anything no matter how much we described the type of wine we liked. We ended up having some okayish Czech wine of which they had several shelves of and tries some really bad one after which we moved to Italian wines.  The restaurant is very atmospheric and the food is indeed cooked in front of you and burrata caprese salad was amazing and the cheeses were good, but the rest of the meals were rather average. Not sure if this was an off night, but we did not experience the great tastes everybody is writing about. We even decided to have dessert somewhere else.

This fantastic little wine bar may not be authentically Czech - it offers essentially Italian ‘tapas’ alongside an extensive selection of wines from Puglia - but it is well worth the visit.

The bruschetta is simple but so fresh, bright and refreshing whilst the other dishes are all freshly prepared in front of you to order. The special - baked ricotta cheese with thyme and lemon zest - was delicious whilst the Italian standards of eggplant parmigiana and tiramisu were fantastic.  Excellent.

As we were leaving the next day, I emailed in the morning and booked a table for opening time at 5pm so we could go before our flight. We were the first in there but it started filling up quickly. Sadly we were in a rush so couldn't stay for dessert or to be have the full experience. I highly recommend booking in advance!  The food is fresh and cooked in front of you, the wine outstanding, theres a huge selection. If you get stuck the waiter can help you. The waiters are attentive and welcoming and like a bit of banter with their customers which is fun!  I can't wait to return here for a proper meal when we have more time, I want to try the desserts! We have decided if we come back we will definately book here for an evening!

The dishes are a creative mix of Czech products with occasional hints of Japanese flavors. I can't say other than that each dish was very flavorful. The wine list consists of many wines from the Czech Republic, so often, I don't drink Czech wine, but they are surprisingly delicious. The Rouci Pinot Noir from Stapleton Springer comes highly recommended. The quality of the food, the staff's hospitality, and the restaurant's atmosphere made it a superb evening for us.

From the beginning to the dessert I was speechless, the best way of eating is sharing with friends. In photo gallery you can see what we had.  I strongly recommend to go there and try. Even though you won’t be staying in Hyatt, it’s worth visiting.  5/5 stars

Chicken Korma, really odd minty taste, we didn’t finish it. A chicken Kadhai, med spicy as described, not much chicken and a Prawn Makhani, tasted like tomato soup and had 5 small prawns. Pesawari naan, looked good on the outside but was greasy and had a strange tomato flavour inside. Waiter was very polite but only cleared half the table and never returned until my husband went to the counter for the bill. Wanted to love it but all in all, we were all disappointed and wouldn’t return.

They can step up the spice level if you ask for it, but otherwise are cognisant of the travelers palate. They special chaat is an excellent starter and the chicken bhuna is an excellent choice.

We couldn’t decide where to eat. For non meat eaters prague restaurants can be a challenge. In the end we choose K the two brothers. And what a hit it was!! Reservation is recommendable because the place was packed. Very nice ambiance inside, great decor all around. We sat near the small bar at a small table. The table appeared to be really small, only just big enough to place our complete meal on. Indian food comes in many bowls and platters, so... About the food: wow. Just wow. So delicious! We eat Indian regularly, but this is #1 so far! We loved it!! We choose not spicy. Started with vegetable samosa and fried shrimps. Already very delicious. Then came the Dal Makhani: Black lentils cooked overnight in the Tandoor finished with tomato sauce & cream. A prawn curry; Tiger prawns in rich sauce with cashews and coconut and the Kashmiri Pulao: Rice mixed with sliced fruits and nuts flavored with aromatic cashmere herbs and cream. I had the pineapple raita and a cheese naan with it. Too much but O man. To die for. So good. So good. So, when in Prague avoid the busy squares and find K the two brothers in old town. Very very recommendable!! Great staff, very attentive, very nice guys! Must eat here when in Prague.

Prague has many cuisines but Indian food certainly ranks up there. This family run eatery is ranked as one of the best, so we decided to give it a try. It was also clear conveniently located to our hotel. The ambiance inside is very charming. The menu is fairly extensive, Lucky our very efficient server was a huge help in deciphering some of the lesser known items. We started with shrimp and a fried spinach appetizers, both were fantastic. For entrees, we sampled a nice cross section of dishes, including shrimp, vegetarian, chicken and lamb. The highlight entree was the “K” special platter with a mixed grill of lamb and chicken cooked in different styles. Several flavors of naan bread rounded out our entrees. Lucky took great care of us throughout the meal and we thought the prices here were reasonable.

Very nice staff. Place is decorated heavily with Indian decor.  Food: One thing I noticed is everything is very expensive. Wouldn't mind it as much if the portions were bigger and the food tasted better but it was just fine. We got our typical things like Butter Chicken, a Lamb dish, garlic naan, Aloo gobi, and a baked fish dish. Also disappointed that no entrees come with any rice so you have to order all the rice separately (again, adds to the expenses).  Fish was super dry and not cooked well at all. Butter chicken was good because you can't really mess up butter chicken. Lamb was not tender and a bit dry. Aloo Gobi had good flavors but small portions too.  We tried this place because we were getting a bit tired of the same european flavors and we we wanted to spice it up after 10 days of travel but I was quite disappointed with this place esp this being one of the most expensive meals I had in 10 days of travel.

It's served on Saturdays and Sundays between 11:30-15:00. The menu changes from week to week. The price is Czk. 1.290, - per person. It includes prosecco, red wine, white wine, beer, coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice and other soft drinks ad libitum. My boss, who is pretty awesome - and has asked me out several times this week - is in Prague with her husband, and I thought it appropriate to ask them out, just once. We usually attend the Grand Restaurant Festival together, but that’s not an option this year. Instead we’ve designed our own culinary week. The menu we had yesterday is below. Food is served at the table. We were given dishes to share, and we were pleased with the portion sizes, which allowed us to taste everything. By the time we had done that, we were also absolutely stuffed. Everything we were served was impressively delicious. The praise came in a stream from all three of us. We were impressed with the quality of the prosecco and wines included in what was effectively an all-you-can-drink package. The service was also absolutely perfect. The team of waiters were quite young and they were well trained in the profession, they were polite, friendly, helpful and had both humour and the courage to bring their personalities to work. When we arrived at 11:30, we discussed whether we could have arrived a little later and still had plenty of time before 15:00. But the service was kind enough to give us plenty of time between courses, we had a good time - and by 14:35 we were ready for dessert, which by the way was a feast of flavours and textures and one of the many highlights of the brunch. We'll be back!  STARTERS Codfish ceviche, shallot, dill Veal tataki, wasabi mayonnaise Beetroot carpaccio, goat cheese, black rice  MAIN DISHES Salmon trout, tabouleh salad, miso, tapioca Pork tenderloin, Guinea-fowl breast, parmesan cheese, herbs, albufera sauce Baked pumpkin, cauliflower, parsley, Brussel sprouts, almond, sweet potato croquete, gruyére cheese, aioli mayonnaise  DESSERTS Pistachio cheesecake, raspberries, chocolate Coconut, almonds, turmeric, vanilla  WINES Prosecco Riondo, extra dry, Veneto White wine: Pinot Grigio , Casalforte, Veneto Red wine: Valpolicella , Casalforte, Veneto

It is safe to say that the restaurant didn’t disappoint. We were all blown away by the experience. We were greeted by the manager (I believe) and sat down at a nice table. The interior of the restaurant has been redone, and we liked it. Particularly we liked the acoustics of the room. Noise doesn’t travel from table to table, and we could have a relaxed conversation without raising our voices or listening in on whatever was being discussed by the table next to ours. We had a bowl of bread with 3 different kinds of fresh and slightly warm bread. It was accompanied by a herb spread which had nice, subtle flavours and a perfect temperature. I wanted more bread! But thank God they didn’t give me any (I didn't ask for it), because we were all completely full, when we left the restaurant a couple of hours later. The amuse bouche was delicate foam of smoked potatoes. There were some crunchy bits on top and a bit of sour notes from tiny pieces of pickled vegetables as well. These 2 elements gave some texture, and it was a brilliant little dish. The starter was smoked char with almond milk “caviar”, beluga lentils, horseradish, and marjoram. The trout had a firm, yet tender texture and had received just the right amount of smoke. The subtle horseradish sauce with marjoram complimented both fish and lentils very well and made everything come together. The lentils were perfectly cooked – I am not sure if “al dente” is a way to describe lentils, but I’ll risk it. The almond milk caviar was mainly on the plate for texture, I believe – it didn’t pack a lot of flavour. I like that the “eggs” had different sizes. That worked well visually and also when it came to the texture. The size of the portion was generous – we all agreed that it wouldn’t have been strange at all, if they had served one piece of trout instead of the two nice portions on our plates. The main dish was veal rib eye, beans, dried beef, beets, cashews, and demi glace. We were given a choice how we would like our meat prepared, and we all chose medium. Mine was closer to medium rare, and that was perfectly fine with me. The first impression of the dish came from tasting the demi glace, which was one of the best I’ve ever had. Only the master of sauces, Steven Trumpfheller, has served me a better one. So rich and full of flavour and reduced to the point where it would make my lips stick together. The steak was tender and well seasoned, and it hade more and deeper flavour than I would have expected from veal – more like a young bull. There were 3 different types of beans on the side, all cooked to perfection. The beets added an earthy and sweet/sour dimension, and the small bites of smoked and dried beef held it together, although my first bite was very tough (the rest weren’t). Just as it was the case with the starter, everything on the plate created a perfect combination, and the dish was quite filling. I regretted not having saved a slice of bread to wipe my plate clean with. Not to embarrass my two friends at the table I decided not to lick the sauce off my plate, but the thought crossed my mind. The dessert was macaroon in two ways, cherry, chocolate, tangerine, and basil garnished with raspberries and a blackberry. The macaroon on the side was good, but to me the star of the dish was the clever composition in the middle. I tried tasting the different elements individually, and they went almost all the way around the palate, except for saltiness. Sweet, sour, tart, bitter. And then when they all met in combination with the chewy and a little bit gooey macaroon bottom, it was simply a heavenly mouthful. The menu mentions a pre-dessert as a palate cleanser. Previously it has been a ball of sorbet. They forgot to serve it at our table, but they found out and insisted that we had coffee on the house, accompanied with cute cubes of chocolaty caramel. It was a nice finish to our meal. The service was friendly and attentive, and we were given plenty of time between dishes, which we really appreciate. We were served by different waiters, but the manager always kept an eye on our table and checked every once in a while if we were happy – and it was a pleasure chatting with him. Hospitality must lie in his genes. We agreed that this final festival experience was a perfect ending to this year’s adventure as a group – and most definitely we’re looking forward to repeating it next year! There are 2 seats left for the Restaurant festival at Mlýnec this year: 1 seat on the 12/2 at 17:30 and 1 on the 16/2 at 17:30. Grab them!

Great job Rodrigo!	We ate here our last night on a recommendation from our hotel. If we had found it sooner we would have eaten here more often. Dinner for 3 was about $200 for 2 mains, three appetizers, 6 drinks, one dessert. Rodrigo did a marvelous job waiting on us. We will be back if we are ever here again. In warm weather there is outside dining in the shadow of the Charles Bridge. Here are the items we really liked: scallops, celery cream soup, goat cheese salad, filet schnitzel (sounds odd but great) and cream puff. Full bar with all the usual mixed drinks. Very pleasant setting with just enough ambient noise to allow a normal conversation. Reservation needed if you want a preferential seating location.

The modern twist to some of the traditional Indian dishes was interesting and intriguing. It was a treat indeed. However there is once serious flaw: uncalled for, super-sonic serving speed. As one can see from my reviews, I have been to a number of top-notched restaurants, the world over, quite often opting degustation menu to experience their gastronomical skills, to the fullest. Tasting or Degustation menu is meant to make guests enjoy each and every bite of the dishes served, at a philosophical pace, and relaxed mood. Many places normally serve palate cleanser before each new dish arrives. They work to remove any aftertastes lingering in the mouth so that guests can enjoy each dish without continuing to taste the last. Surprisingly, V Zátiší serves some of its dishes in pairs which results sometimes in different [and wrong] combination than what is intended or appropriate and sometimes, one of the dishes getting cold, losing its lustre. V Zatisi opts to bulldoze it through. Exaggerating a little bit, of course. I am unable to see any culinary justification or business rationale for this unnecessary haste. I would dare to state that it is a cardinal sin to spoil a superb concept in this way.

The place is located in a quiet alley not far from Charles Bridge, is nicely furnished and has an OK variety of food choices. We chose the Indian degustation, which consisted of an amouse bouche, a soup, a fish, tikka masala and a dessert. The highlight of the meal were the mains, while the other dishes to us seemed only a way to complete a menu. Soup decent but not at its price tag, dessert was good but spices from the pineapple overpowered the Gelato. Overall food was good and we enjoyed it, but I think for its price it is definitely not worth it. Upon arriving, we Said we had made a reservation but at the desk they did not have it, but luckily it was not busy at 12. Service was unfortunately luckluster and not up to the standard of a high-end restaurant; in such other premises in Prague the waiting staff would enunciate meals, here no one said a thing and for each dish I needed to go online and check their website. Frantisek was nice (the lady so so, especially when we showed the voucher) but all in all I think if they want to charge this much some improvements need to be taken. I tipped (as I have never tipped in my country actually) but did not feel like doing it.

The first impression from the decor is clean and sort of lacking personality or local character: nothing fancy, for all you know, you could be in the lounge of a Hilton anyweher in the world. That's after the first nice course of our tasting menu was served that things quickly turned bad: from the aged ""tartare"" that tasted like old, dry chewing gum and looked more like rabbit poop to the tasteless spike trout or rubbery duck, even an applestrudel that was barely baked, no sugar, no crunch, no flavor...All of that was not at par with a Michelin star-even one-standard, service was ok albeit slow and sometimes inattentive although Libor tried his best...A $75 prix fixe in Prague would and should take you to an incredible level. anywhere else...but this one was one of the worst we experienced in the Czarch capital...even a little lunch at a street Chinese restaraurant the next day was flavorful, fresh and tasty for a mere $10 per person !!! I am not sure why this restaurant that seemes to be operated by Indian owners got to receive the Star or glowing social media reviews here...but I do know, as a French born -now American citizen living in the USA and having dined at more than 50 of the best Michelin star restaurants in the world- that this was one of the most disappointing, deplorable if not outrageous dining experience I ever had in the past 40 years..."

Wine pairings were with generous pours, excellent whites and ok reds. Food presentation was good, Indian courses were tasty, the other courses a bit less flavorful. One star off because one of our dining partners ordered the steak and it was tough, requiring a lot of sawing to cut.

Six meals tasting menu was out of this world: Snails in green pea coulis, foie gras, carbonara of potatoes spaghetti, quenelle of pike perch, duck breast and almond lukewarm cake. Potatoes spaghetti carbonara was the most delicious dish for me.  Service was really good, even though we had a trainee waitress and she was a bit nervous to tell us all ingredients in upcoming dish. Wine waiter was also very professional and always ready to help.  I have never been in V Zátiší before even though I know their catering very well. That was not my last visit for sure. Top of that I had incredible birthday fireworks with my dessert and that was another surprise :-) Many thanks for making my special day even special.

An amuse bouche was brought up with bread. Our meals of duck variation and veal fillet looked small but we're filling. The flavours were wonderful. Dessert was just as good. White chocolate mousse was a little dense and pistachio panda cotta was a little loose but tastes great. My wife had the dessert sampler, creme brulee, chocolate mousse and raspberry sorbet which she said ticked all the boxes. The praline and macaron petit fours rounded the meal off nicely. This is not my usual type of restaurant and way above what i normally pay but i didn't feel conned by the price and felt the whole experience was worth the money.

When we visited, there were two large parties downstairs so we settled in for a wait. We were told there would be a delay in our food arriving which was fine, we had time so made the choice to stay. Had a couple of really lovely cocktails and the OH had a large beer and an aperitif. We actually received our food pretty quickly and were so glad we decided to stay and wait. I had the Caesar burger, a patty with lettuce, croutons, Parmesan and delicious Caesar dressing. Hubby had bacon, cheese, rocket and caramelised onions with his. Both were absolutely delicious. Decent portion of good fries on the side. Really reasonably priced considering what we had and the quality. This place is a little off the beaten track although still really central. But it’s not somewhere you’d necessarily walk past on a tourist route. Search it out, I heartily recommend it. One of the best burgers I’ve had for a long long time.

The location is small with seating for about 20-25. I went for lunch and loved the Caesar burger and fries. The burger was cooked to perfection and the toppings and bun were fresh. The fries are thin and served crispy, just the way they should be. They also have Czech beer on tap and cocktails to complete your meal. The servers were super friendly they all speak great English. I will definitely be back when I visit Prague again.

The previous night we visited a Mexican and had nachos and the ones at ‘The Street’ were much better. The nachos were that could we decided to stay even longer and order a burger each. We ordered the burger with the 4 different types of cheese and the chicken in cornflakes. Both were delicious and they were huge! We both agreed they are the best burgers we’ve had in a while and we would 100% recommend.

Its very high quality, perfect service who were truly helpful on our visit. Relaxed casual clothing - jeans & trainers were fine, but not casual casual!  The only thing that disappointed was that it was the ambience of the place. It's basically a hotel bar, being attached to the hotel and therefore it was smart and clean (good!) but lacked any real character. So come for great food & cocktails just off Wenceslas square, but don't come for the setting - it has none.

This is a large, light and airy bar in the lobby of the Radisson Blu Hotel. The staff are extremely knowledgeable and very friendly.  They have any drink you could want from wines to cocktails and spirits but they also have a special cocktail menu which runs along the theme of 'be something' ie be an alchemist, be offline, be a Chef, be Woody etc. These cocktails all come with props and some of them are very theatrical but great fun.  We tried quite a few of the cocktails off this menu because it was so good that we visited twice whilst on our trip to Prague. All the staff were really friendly and we got chatting to Jan at the bar on both visits, what a star he is.  My best tips are sit at the bar if you can, order off of the ""Be"" cocktail menu, get involved and have some fun. We are back to Prague this October and will definitely be back in here."

It really is a mystery as to what is going to arrive! Mine tasted good too, which is always a bonus. My hubby wasn't too keen on his, and whilst the setup and props were good, it was disappointing that his 'cocktail' was an already made drink. We like some work going into our cocktails, so something already made was not as pleasing. Definitely worth a visit though.

Great fun. Great staff	With our stay at the Radisson Blu we received credit for the bar and restaurant, so we used ours in Be Bop bar.  Before I talk about the drinks, I want to talk about the staff. We sat at the bar for 3 nights, and on two nights were attended to by Honza (I hope that’s his name). Sure - you can just drink the drinks for theatre and get drunk and fall off your bar stool.  But what we learned over 3 nights is just how much time, energy, intelligence and creativity goes into the formulation of the recipes AND the ingredients that go into them. They make many of their own ingredients, and the processes take a long time and a lot of care and skill.  Now, to the cocktails.  They are unique, fun, beautifully balanced and well worth trying. I won’t say much about them, but if you want to sit at a bar, dressed in a laboratory coat and a safety mask, while a cocktail basically explodes in front of you, this is the place to go!  As well as their own list of house cocktails, they’ll make pretty much any cocktail you suggest.  BRILLIANT!

What a lovely place.  The restaurant is out of the tourist ""beaten path"" but it is really worth the detour. I started with wonderful, tasty, quail ravioli, spinach, lemon. I then had as a copious main course the shredded leg of lamb, potato puree, baked vegetables. I ended up with a lovely dessert: Baked yoghurt, plums, poppy seeds.  The restaurant has a nice selection of wines by the glass and an amazing list of wines (bottles). I had wine by the glass (being solo). I took a glass of white wine Sonberk 2017 (Chardonnay and Pinot gris) and for dessert a glass of Sonberk Palava 2016. Sonberk is the icon of Czech Republic´s winemaking. First time I tasted their wines but I loved it. I also found the cutlery rest very nicely designed.  After lunch, I had a tour of the beautiful wine cellar of the restaurant: amazing bottles! I had lunch in the covered patio overlooking the cobblestone courtyard. They have several little dining room, if you want a more intimate dinner. Opposite to the courtyard, they also have a building where they have the wine cellar as well as a dining room with a vaulted ceiling. They organize event of wine tasting there. Grand Cru was a lovely discovery with great food, friendly staff! Due to Covid, there were only few customers. However, I will definitely go again to Grand Cru when I return to Prague."

Thank goodness our concierge new this place because I'm sure it is better than anything we would have chosen. Superb food,... attentive, well informed waiters and for a sunny evening the perfect conservatory style room decorated with flair. This is a fantastic find for those wanting the very best fine dining experience. It does not have a Michelin star yet but I'm convinced that it is not far away. My only negative note would be that wine by the glass seems mean even by French standards. It is a drop more than the average Australian tasting. BUT... food of this quality for $70 a head is hard to beat. Only one restaurant has come near this place in our three weeks of travel so far. Almost perfection!!

Nicely decorated and intimate; very nice and friendly atmosphere. Personal greeting by the manager. Most of the guests are local, both business people and couples/groups of friends. Dress code appears to be mostly smart casual, but you can come in jeans if you want.  They have a 6 course tasting menu with small portions of the chef's signature dishes with accompanying wines. This is what we ordered. Beautifully arranged and with many special tastes. Somewhat classic French cuisine; i.e. not that innovative (but that probably is intentional). Clearly, technically of the highest level. The accompanying (French) wines were well chosen and of very good quality. We did have a look at the winelist also. It contains a very long list of mainly French wines (they also have wines from other countries, but the most extensive list is the French one), in line with the name of the restaurant.  Although we told the waiter we were not in a hurry, the speed of serving the courses was rather high. Service was rather routinely performed, in what appeared a hurry and not that personal. The waiter that brought the dishes was not able to explain them, other than the main ingredient (""duck!""). That was a pity; perhaps it was a language issue.  For this high class restaurant, pricing was fully acceptable but on the high end in Prague.  All in all, technically perfect cooking, a nice atmosphere, but it would be nice if the service would be somewhat more relaxed and informative."

Tasteful. Bliss.	We adored Grand Cru. My husband found it researching Prague and we were so happy he did! We went for lunch. Showed up a little late (probably around 2pm) but they didn't mind at all and served us with a smile. We got the two-course lunch menu but got an amuse-bouche to start and Petit fours to finish. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable and willing to chat about the food, wine, and city. Would highly recommend to anyone going to Prague - a great break from all the heavy Czech food.

Rangoli doesn't mess around when authentic Indian food is concerned. From start to finish, everything on the menu is well prepared and presented.  I opted for the chicken Vindaloo - a hot dish for those into spice. I particularly liked the finishing touches of Mukhwas, which serves as authentic after dinner mints. /Mukh/ and /vas/ - denoted in the name, Mukhwas - literally translate as mouth and smell.  A meal consisting of a meat curry, rice, garlic naan (breads), five drinks and a Kulfi (Indian ice-cream) came to a very reasonable 840 CZK (just under 30GBP). This was plenty for the two of us and shall be returning with friends over the next couple of weeks.  As for the service I cannot fault it and was the prominent quality of our dining experience. The waiters greeted me with clemency and their attention to our overall comfort throughout our dining experience was sharp.

The location is quite nice and very comfortable. The only issue experienced was there was a long wait before being greeted upon entering. To start, the roti canai paratha was chosen and the shredded teriyaki beef was incredibly flavorful. For the main, the red curry was equally excellent with a good amount of spice to it. The space was very inviting, comfortable and had a nice vibe. The location is not overly big, but spacious enough. The toilets were comfortable and kept very clean. The overall experience here was quite good and would definitely visit again in the future.

Mirek responded to all of my emails not only very quickly but also in English which of course is not his native tongue. The restaurant is quite a long way out from the centre of Prague, but as we were not staying in the centre and were the right side of Prague for this particular restaurant, it was only about a 15 mins taxi ride which we booked via our hotel. Mirek was very friendly and welcoming and very helpful with recommendations and advice - both on the menu and on Prague. The food was beautifully presented and tasted awesome! As it was a special birthday meal, we had 3 courses (rabbit and lamb for main courses) together with a bottle of wine, a dessert wine, a digestif and a coffee and it came to around £70 all in for 2 of us which we felt very reasonable given the quality of the food. The choice on the menu was plentiful and they brought rustic artisan bread with a pork pate to nibble on whilst choosing our dishes. There was something for everybody wanting to eat true Czech food. This is not your English chicken & chips pub nor a czech menu for tourists. This is a quality restaurant serving quality food for a special occasion - just what we wanted on my 50th birthday celebration and we couldn't have chosen a better place. The service was excellent and it was very busy. In fact they were fully booked on a Friday evening - out of season - so I would highly recommend pre-booking as we saw people being turned away. Quite a lot of local Czech diners too which I always think is a good sign. We would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant for a special occasion and we would definitely return. Thank you Mirek! It was a delight!

It was the very best decission ever. Although we did not have a reservation (wich you shoul really try to do) they offered us a table for 1.5 hr. The service was always friendly and professional, you could feel how they enjoy their work. We were offered a glass of prosecco and it was good with some bread and a delicious home made pâté. Our waiter recomended us his favorites, so we had the plate with a small portion of all starters, I had the veal cheeks in red wine and my partner had the roasted duck breast, both were delicious, the sauces were great and the meat was tender, tasty, perfect! We shared a creme brulee and it was the perfect end for the perfect meal. I had a lemonade with grapefruit, it was also very good. As a whole, it was a nice experience and we are looking forward to go again to Prag and to Pepr a Sul. If you are visiting Prag and looking for a good meal, you shoul go to this place.

My gf had the veal cheek and I had the rabbit and both were prepared to perfection. The flavors were truly delicious. The two men who run the place were so nice, they attended to our every need and went above an beyond when a plate dropped and splattered on my gf's jacket. They treated us like friends and took care of everything we needed. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. The food, atmosphere and staff are top notch.

Make sure you reserve and go a little hungry the food is fantastic, the service wonderful together with Marina definitely in the top two places we tried while in Prague. Totally totally good.  Perhaps $100 for two even after you have plenty of Prosecco and three courses. Extremely good value for money if you come from the rest of continental Europe.

Great atmosphere, thoughtful and creative way of presenting daily menus. Rich selection of beverages. Interesting combinations of tastes and preparation styles. I decided to go with beef broth and flank steak. Food presentation was modern and classic at the same time (this way I like it the most).The only reason why I’m not giving 5* is that on my taste there was too much marinade on the meat and therefore the taste of it overcomes the pure taste of the flank steak. Another thing was that I ordered this steak with green beans made on bacon and some of them were still ice-cold, but this is a common mistake and it did’t destroy the whole experience. I would truly recommend anyone to come to this place.

Complimentary champagne on arrival for our celebration - thank you!  We went for the a la carte - 2 starters (carpaccio and soup), 3 mains (duck, rabbit and lamb chop & shoulder) and 1 dessert (white chocolate).. for 2 of us.. we couldn't decide between 2 mains so got 3!  All of the food was great -especially the duck, so highly recommend this dish. Being in Czech Republic we wanted to try a Czech wine. A very different wine and not what we'd normally choose, but it did grow on me! Our waiter (light haired middle-aged guy - sorry I've forgotten his name!) was faultless. The service from all staff was fantastic. Very attentive and even offering other wine free of charge when we weren't keen on the Czech!  Thank you again for a wonderful evening! I would highly recommend Blue Wagon. Fantastic food, great service and great value for money!

We told the waiter that we couldn't decide what we loved more - the kulajda soup, the beef tongue in horseradish source, the deer tenderloin... It was all cooked perfectly and the combination of tastes was perfect for a cold Bohemian evening. The wine was good by the class, but pricey. The dessert was lovely - but an extra scoop of that lovely ice cream would have made our evening absolutely perfect. Definitely a restaurant to which we will return.

The service was fantastic - and the food was excellent. The waitress was just chatty enough for a lovely evening. The menu is limited, but the food is well prepared, the portions are a perfect size and the tastes are wonderful. We started with the prawns with passion fruit, chili and coriander and were gobsmacked! The taste was perfect - and prawns were served warm. The homemade bread and butter with seasalt was a wonderful addition. For the main I had the veal steak and my partner had the rabbit - which was tender and not dried out! The wine by the glass was good, but served only by the deciliter. And the dessert menu was too limited for us. We would have had a dessert, but they were only two sweet desserts and a cheese plate. We went home to have our own. Would definitely recommend this restaurant and we hope to return!

Booked this restaurant for a weekend in Prague based on the positive reviews and it lived up to expectations! Firstly Blue Wagon is situated in a lovely neighbourhood, away from the main tourist areas but very easily accessible by public transport.... at first slightly disappointed as had set my heart on the tasting menu although this finished at 8pm (*) so chose off 'a la carte'... disappointment didn't last very long as I enjoyed an excellent 3 course dinner with a little a 'surprise' thrown in by the restaurant.... all great quality and very tasty. Service was excellent with really nice surroundings and decor.. would recommend to anyone visiting Prague looking for a nice dining experience.  * Visiting the more Mediterranean cities am used to dining later 9pm / 10pm ..... based on a brief visit Prague seems to dine earlier with restaurants empty by 1030 / 11....

I had booked, it wasn’t busy for a Friday night but it isn’t a big restaurant so I would advise booking so you don’t miss out.  Staff are friendly and welcoming. The menu has enough choices of starters and mains so to satisfy everyone’s taste.  Two of us started with the goat cheese with marinated beetroot, it was perfect with the goats cheese melting in your mouth. Another dining partner went for the rabbit broth which she said was very good.  Mains, I had the supreme chicken which went well with the chilli marmalade. Two others had the duck which was generous in size and cooked just right. Another had the beef which was also a winner.  Only one of us went for a dessert of chocolate mousse which was very rich and a great way to end the meal.  With a bottle of wine, the meal was slightly expensive but definitely worth it and we enjoyed it thoroughly. Highly recommend!

I did have such high hopes.	After seeing such great reviews this restaurant was on my wife an I's `bucket list' of places to visit. The food was of a very good standard, well cooked and presented very professionally. The wine menu was also well selected and varied. The thing that let this venue down was the poor level of service generally. The lady serving us was appeared confused, did not know what was on the menu (the menu id not particularly lengthy) and paid poor attention to us even though it was fairly empty. Instead both her and her colleague focused on two gentlemen who we assumed were regularly from their conversations. We also waited a very long time after having our plates cleared away before being offered desert. For such a venue and with prices set as they are I would have expected better having dined at a large number of other places in Prague of the same level. My wife and I do not plan on coming back again.

Complimentary garlic bread was delicious and so was the extra bread we requested to mop up the sauce that came with the lamb and venison options of the main course. All of the food was terrific- not one moan or gripe about anything from anyone in our group of 6. Thomasz did us a selection of desserts to share between us plus a cheeseboard and then a port to seal the deal. I finished up with a ginger tea- made with wonderful fresh ginger, lemon and honey- the BEST I have ever had! I'm going back to Prague and will come back here too!

Mixing creative flavors and proteins (venison, pheasant, octopus) with more traditional Czech fare yields a menu that is fun, challenging and changes frequently. It was so good we ate there on consecutive nights. Each time I had the venison, which is easy to ""get wrong"" -- but it was perfect in seasoning, sauce, cooking temperature and a duet of thin-sliced asparagus and polenta cakes. The plate presentation is as good as any New York high end restaurant - but expect to spend about 1/4 of what you would in the Big Apple. The best leading indicator is the wine list -- carefully curated and personally selected, and priced for you to enjoy a variety of pairings, not make you feel guilty about venturing into new areas. The wait staff knows the wines (including obscure Italian vintages) and was perfectly attentive. Possibly the best meal I have eaten in Europe."

And though some restaurants are just there to meet friends and have a nice chat, this place is all about it's food. At least they got us and specially the kids wraped round there little finger. The menu has a broad variety of interesting food, there is a good choice of wines (try some of the czech ones). The food and the wine we had was both time a sheer delight. The only thing: this place might want to work on the choice of aperitifs.  So you might think there is a snap to it? Actually no. The prices a fair, there is nothing to complain about. Well, the only thing might be the pronounciation of the road ""Uruguayska"" - Hungarien road. Rather tell your cab driver you want to go to Blue Wagon restaurant. But if you are looking for a special light bulb moment about food - give it a shot and reserve a table at the Blue Wagon."

Absolutely brilliant. Pleasant staff, lovely surroundings, food awesome. My wife had the wild boar and I had the duck with raspberry, what a wonderful taste on both meals. The waiter recommended a lovely red wine (Roučí 2008, Stapleton-Springer, Bořetice) which complimented the food really well.  For dessert we shared the cheeses and fig board which again was splendid. Followed by tea and coffees.  All this came to under £45 for the two of us.

Ble Wagon is a lovely resturant with great food, however our waiter was quite arrogant. We didn't get any bread or nibbles when other tables did, we had a lovely bottle of wine, and asked for it by the glass at the end of the meal. The bottle we had was a 2010, the glasses were 2008, the waiter said it was the same wine, I said it couldn't be as it was a different year, but he disagreed with me, which I thought was rude, plus the size of the glass he poured was very small, when other people were having wine their glasses were twice the size. As I said the food was fantastic and I would recommend it, but the service was disappointing.

Real value for money and highly recommended not only for dinner, but also for surprisingly delicious business lunch. I haven't had such good beef on mushrooms with sauce and dumplings for quite a long time, the meat was just melting down in mouth. And even though I am usually not raving about sweets, their dessert a brownie like cade made from rye flour was exactly as tailor made to my taste not so sweet. These guys know to do their job very well and I am sure to repeat the visit soon.

Being from an Asian background, I feel other communities are blinded by this place as it does not offer the best ethnic taste. Our food was over cooked and the veg dish ordered was tasteless. We did speak to the lady about this and she was adamant that this is how the dish is made. Most of the food went back full but no good will gesture was offered knowing that we didn't eat it.  I am still talking about this place because it is by far the worst place I've eaten at. I would also like to add that when we left the restaurant, the chef came out and was quite inappropriate waving and calling us back in let's just say not in a professional capacity. Perhaps females need to not visit alone.  I am shocked how many good reviews this place has.

Very good Indian restaurant, the food was awesome and very satisfying. The only thing though was that in the menu, it said Coke, I ordered it, I got a Pepsi, you don't do that, it really threw me off, Coke is always better, if it says Coke on the menu, then you should serve Coke. This is the reason why this restaurant won't get an excellent from me.

PLUS the food and service is outstanding!  The food menu changes daily, so you never know exactly what you will be served, but it doesn't matter because they have both vegetarian and meat dishes; which are properly spiced.  Will I go again? Of course, I am planning a trip tomorrow and maybe next week!  Oh yeah, and you get a free piece of Naan!!!

Located in the basement of the building, nice ambience.....service was friendly and good, mostly efficient but some things took a bit longer than expected.  I had a spinach based curry which was spicier than expecting and didn't have a lot of chicken in it, my colleague had a tikka masala which he found lacking in flavour.  Rice was ok....had peas in it which was odd (for an indian) but then we've experienced peas on pizza this week so not all that weird.  The poppadoms we had for starters were strange, cone shaped and quite small but they were fairly priced so not a problem, not enough indian dips with them though.  Usual selection of drinks, no problems there and the peshwari naan was very good.  Some people came in with a very large dog, don't really like dogs in restaurants but it was fairly well behaved so not a major issue.

When people say JW Marriott Resort and Spa is an incredible place to visit, believe them. In fact, book yourself a stay right away and find out for yourself! We’ve been to this resort a few times being MVC members and every single visit seems to outdo the previous one. Service is definitely top-notch and here at the Rim Nam Pool Bar, the service crew - Lert, Sert, Kai, Man, and Peter - certainly go out of their way to ensure all guests are well looked after. For example: You don’t even have to keep asking for iced water, there is always someone walking around pouring everyone a cold drink of water. They also have popsicles in the morning for the young ones. And this afternoon, my daughter met a little accident while running and had small scratches on her knees. Immediately, there was a resort staff to attend to her wound. Truly appreciated! Food and cocktails are delicious! We’ve certainly had more than our fair share of mango daiquiris in between dips in the pool. Now, the beach just a few steps down is gorgeous especially on a warm sunny day! You can take walks, or even a leisurely run, sunbathe, play sandcastles with the kids, and more. This resort is really something else and we always look forward to visiting at least once a year!

Location  The La Sala restaurant is located within a beautiful lagoon surrounded by tropical plants and birds. It can be found within the Anantara Phuket Villas a short walk from Turtle Village, Anantara vacation club and JW Marriot. The maintained beach is a short walk away.  Staff and service  The service we received was some of the best we have had in all of Asia. Staff are extremely attentive, fully aware of dietary requirements and needs of customers. We are vegan (no meat, fish, dairy) so it can often be quite tricky, but La Sala staff were quick to recommend delicious alternatives.  I have a 5 year old boy that can get restless during large breakfasts. The staff were quick to recognise this and suggested that he tried feeding fish. Also while ordering, the staff suggested certain foods he might like to try. These personal touches puts this restaurant above the competition.  Food  Every dish that we tried was excellent and full of flavour. There are a number of western and Asian dishes to choose from. In my five days, I tried most of them. The food was made and delivered quickly.  Covid  During this challenging time, it is highly important that hotels and restaurants have a impeccable level of cleanliness. La Sala was extremely clean with all staff socially distancing and wearing masks.  Finally  At this stage I would like to personally thank Khun Samorn, Ann Waad Tuk and Goong for their amazing service and attentiveness during our stay. You have all gone above and beyond your duty.  We will never forget the service at La Sala. I will recommend this restaurant to friends and relatives. Thank you.

The quality oft he food is excellent. The buffet meals at there Marriott Cafe are well worth a visit but be careful as during low season they are few and far between. They have different themes and in my experience they are all great value. Good for families and they always have child friendly dishes available.

So it's out of necessity and convenience that we had our daily buffet breakfast in this restaurant. And we are very happy we did. Food offers and spreads are great.For starters, they had so many appetisers and soups including their culinary masterpiece and favourite Tom Yang. This time it's on the light side version as against the heavy soup that is typically served. Great variety of Japanese and international cuisine : bacon, sausages, ham, omelletes,sushi bar, salad bar, desserts: local fruits like dragon fruit, pineapple,jackfruit, etc. A great way to start the day of beautiful memories. Of course, one can also order a la carte for set breakfast menus which in itself is very generous in serving size. Be early coz waiting time can be challenging.

We stayed at the Navatara Resort and Tripadvisor shared this nearby place with us. I cased it out during the day as it is down an odd side road. But wow! We arrived just at sunset and should have arrived a bit earlier for full sunset viewing. Little blinky lights and folks welcoming us at the front door...only a foreshadowing to the wonderful evening in store. The deck was wonderful and we were given a seat at the edge for a great view. We ordered a bottle of nice wine and soup for a starter. We shared three dishes...pork curry, sunflower sprouts (awesome if you haven't tried in Thailand yet!), and fried prawns with black pepper. Everything was well spiced. Dishes were smaller than almost any other Thai place we've eaten, but that left room for dessert. We chose three classics and shared mango with sticky rice, a flan-like dish, and fried bananas with ice cream. All was excellent. Live music was most enjoyable and we watched families and couples if all ages enjoying themselves! We didn't want to leave! Heartily recommend. Our bill was about 2500 baht and the wine was about half of the bill.

Few though have great food at a reasonable price as well.  Rawai View Cafe oozes character; it's just a beautiful looking place that fits in nicely with its surroundings.  The staff are very friendly, the food comes out quick and the view just makes it an enjoyable place to be.  What was surprising though was the quality of the food and the presentation of it. Yes good food is not uncommon in Thailand but Rawai View Cafe's food is that little bit better.  We had spicy beef salad, garlic fried snapper and penang beef curry, and mango shakes - all delicious.  Tie that together with the presentation of the food, the service, the view, cheap prices and a nice place and they have a great all-round restaurant they can be proud of. There's free WiFi also!  If you're looking for a restaurant that ticks all the boxes for food, service, value and experience, this is it.

Recommend for a change in scenery from the resort. Pains me to say there seems to be an “honest mistake” scheme running with happy hour. The invoice each time is brought over and they quickly show your free drinks but the total you pay also includes the free. If you question it they then remove the “free ones” . Every time same problem. When pointed out the 3rd time the waitress got passive aggressive and began being super assertive. It is a classic ruse to gain funds. Don’t begrudge them in this time however check your bill if you care about your happy hour drinks :). Would I go back - sure. Would I trust the bill - no way

They also have spit roasted chicken on the menu with some great flavours. My wife and daughter are both vegetarian which can sometimes be a problem while on holiday but there were plenty of options for them here, they really enjoyed the salad and penne arrabbiata as well as the fresh pizzas. I will definitely return again next time we’re in Phuket! Thanks for a great evening all at The Kitchen Table!

You can eat in or take away and also there's room service . We did eat out at the Blue Mango a couple of times and the experiences here were really good too. We decided to try to lamb steak at the kitchen table and were so glad we did, we enjoyed it so much we had our last holiday meal at the Kitchen Table, this time we had the pork dish, and this did not disappoint either . The kitchen table is definitely on a par with the blue mango. Poppy and the whole team are so friendly , helpful , always smiling , they are a great bunch, and an absolute credit to their employers. Thanks to all for a great stay!

It was our second visit to this awesome resort, the first being a little over 1 year ago.  Whilst at the resort we made a number of visits to the Sala Sawasdee bar. It’s a great place to relax and have a drink, regardless if you’re a hotel guest or visiting from the outside.  Something that really makes the place special is the staff and the stand out for my family was Mai Butsaba. It has been over a year since our last visit and Mai instantly recognised my family and particularly my daughters. She went out of her way to make us feel welcome on every visit. Thank you Mai.  It’s a great spot to sit and have a cocktail on the evening when the fire show is on, just get there early to make sure you get a water side day bed.  Thanks Sala Sawasdee team and especially Mai, we have a wonderful visit and look forward to seeing you all again soon.

First glance great set up around the pool but needs some attention to detail 1). Great gazpacho but served in large bowls where a small cup of glass would have been ideal. As the lunch wore on bowls exposed to sun so placing a chilled soup into a hot bowl not good. 2) mixed French oysters with oysters from Surin Thani (Thai) but no warning or sign to distinguish. 3) lots of sauces for beef but none for lamb- where was mint sauce or mint jelly. Lamb and beef both medium and dry. Lamb chops not top quality. Too much fat 4) salads were very good as was Thai food. Grapes cheap end with seeds but Chees selection ok.  Overall not the 5 star experience that Andara aspires to. 5) lots of staff but not interfacing with guests- most chatting amongst themselves.

The food was simply delightful - perfectly cooked, superbly presented and with friendly and attentive service. All-in-all, this was a really great dining experience made so by a very talented chef who clearly knows what he is doing and by staff who work hard to ensure your enjoyment and satisfaction. Other interesting dishes on the menu will ensure a return visit to Blue Mango, for another sunset dinner, is now a MUST!

The Duck is also delicious as is the Almaretto Sweet potato ravioli. Can’t go past the Cinnamon Apple Crumble or Sticky Mango Rice, teal favourites.  As there is a huge menu, including Thai Food, you will want to come back again.  Thank you for a great time. See you all again next time.

We enjoyed sampling some of the signature dishes of locally sourced food -Andaman prawns with sea grapes became my favourite starter. Main course portions were very generous. The chef’s willingness to substitute duck for beef in a Mussiman curry and to tone down the heat on some of the spicier dishes was much appreciated. The Valentine’s Meal this year was especially tasty

I was lucky to stay there during the pandemic for a few months. So this time I purposely return for their food, they serve tasty and flavorful dishes with some unique local ingredients and surprising twists. The service there is excellent and professional as always. This place is absolutely the one if you look for a causal Thai dining place with international standard, still offering full Thai tastes. The last thing you must order is dessert. They currently have good choices of sweet, however if you are lucky enough ask for Chef Fon to surprise you with her Thai dessert of the day. It’s off the menu. Chef Fon has real skills for Thai dessert that are not so easy to find these days. I just hope that the restaurant is going to add more of her sweets such as Tab Tim Krob in the menu. I would love to have it for my afternoon treat.  - Patrick

All of the staff - Sam, Amp, Will, Puen, Ness and Paul - went out of their way make our experience enjoyable and learn our preferences in terms of level of spiciness. We liked to sit outside with the ocean view so they provided an ice bucket to keep our Singha beers cold. The extensive menu meant we never ate the same main course twice, though we always chose the same shared mixed starters. The Valentine's Day Meal was a particular triumph with an amazing variety of meat, vegetables and seafood, including lobster.  I was also lucky enough to be able to eat here for breakfast on a couple of mornings when they opened up as the hotel was very full. The Chef's Signature Eggs on smashed avocado, tomato salsa and sour dough served to the table with a fresh fruit smoothie and sparkling wine made a heavenly start to the day. I was quite upset when this stopped and I had to return to the busy hotel buffet.  Be sure to make a reservation for dinner as we saw several people turned away as they didn't have space. Thank you Takieng for a five-star dining experience every night of our stay. x

Unfortunately still disappointing.  Last time: calamari tasted like shoe leather. Tough. I was told ""those are European calamari, not same as Thai""... ?!  This time: Pad Thai came out almost instantly. It was cold, the tamarind sauce tasted ""off"" (sort of like a fermented or blue cheese flavor which doesn't belong). I wasn't in the mood to complain.  I have not had a dish here lately which I would describe as ""memorable"".  This restaurant should provide a memorable dining experience to guests and visitors. It's a Thai themed restaurant so for sure it should get thai food right.  For some reason, Sandbox's kitchen puts out consistently well tasting dishes but clearly Takieng is struggling and not exactly in the inexpensive side."

The menu has some Thai traditional dishes but also some not so well known ones and the Grouper with three sauces is our favourite. It comes filleted and has amazing flavours. We ate here twice and if we were here another day we would have been back for a third day. Definitely one of the highlights of staying at this hotel. Do not miss it!

Eat outside if you want a magical experience, air con when your in the tropics is overrated. Our favourite dishes were the Thai fish cakes and the hot and sour beef. If you have a sweet tooth go the sticky rice and fresh mango it finishes off your meal nicely.  All staff were fabulous but we very much appreciated the services of Rueben, he was a stand out!

All the staff are extremely professional,attentive and friendly. Special mention to Goong who looked after us every evening and is one of the nicest waitresses we have met anywhere in the world. @ management please make sure she gets made aware of this review. We'll be back again next year for more delicious food.

Was a buggy ride away from the hotel room.  The view from the restaurant was great. Good before the sunset so that you can enjoy both the sunset and the night view.  Alfresco dining is recommended because you will have the unblocked view to the sea and the pool. But get ready your insect repellent and embrace the heat because the fans weren't helping much.  We ordered a set menu for 2 pax. Was decent but nothing exceptional. The pace of serving was a little too lengthy, we actually got bored waiting for food after a while. We got seated by 6 pm and we left the restaurant at 8.30 pm.  Would I recommend this to anyone? If you are staying at the resort, why not because you don't have much choices there.  If you are making a trip here from elsewhere, I don't think you miss much.

While spending a week in Phuket, we were looking for some good restaurants and we found some good reviews on the Dee Plee so we decided to give a try, knowing that Anantara is a very good and well recognized brand in Thailand.  The restaurant is located on the hills of the hotel, overlooking the hotel grounds, the sea and the beach. The decoration of the hotel is perfect, in Lanna style (northern thailand style) and the Lanna inspiration can be traced back in the menu... !  The menu is traditional thai with a number of plates from northern thailand (which is a different style from the south of thailand). Everything we ordered came in a very nice presentation and all the tastes were just amazing!! We had the possibility to have different type of rice, which is always great since Thailand has so much to offer on this front. The staff was super friendly and smiling and they contribute very significantly to the overall experience you have at Dee Plee. To me, Dee Plee is part of those restaurants who are truly honoring Thai food by offering to the guests a true culinary experience.  On thing to note, not so many restaurants in Thailand bring you the miang kham when you have dinner. Miang kham is actually the traditional thai snack that people enjoy when they are together. It consists of a bethel leave that you fill with roasted peanuts, coco, lime, shallots and some spicy paste. It is delicious and the perfect snack when you are having a beer or a glass of wine in Thailand but too few restaurants offer this.. I was really happy that Dee Plee has it.  All in all, we would certainly come back and highly recommend it!

The food was as always very good, but the service was absolutely not, in fact it was really not what we had expected at all. The restaurant wasn’t hugely busy but we were pretty much ignored by the staff and took ages to take a dessert order then even longer to bring the desserts. If this had been our first impression of the Nai Harn, I don’t think we would have wanted to look any further. Fortunately the staff in all other parts of the hotel are fantastic, friendly and efficient. I just wouldn’t bother eating at Rock Salt next time, which is a great pity.

We were very early and their first guests. The service was friendly and correct, but more important the food was fabulous. Ordered the salmon and a well grilled beefsteak after our appetizer of different pieces of bread. It was delicious!!! The price of course was related to the quality a bit higher. But happy we choose this restaurant and it will be on our favourite list in Phuket when we come back!

The food was overall reasonable to good, common problem with steak in Thaiand though, always will be overcooked so if you would like medium rare, order rare or blue. The house wine was very good. I did not drink the cocktails so have no comment. The staff including the owner were nice and friendly.

Well, I’ve been admiring the pictures of Big Boys Burger Club offerings for three years and finally put his claim to the test.  Sorry Fred, the picture simply doesn’t convey the explosion of taste in that first mouthful of juicy double stack burger that is the El Clasico, sheer burger bliss. I elected to have the patties cooked medium well, and the result was a juicy burger with two patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and the tomato aioli sauce. The Big Boy, another winner with the crispy bacon topping the patties. Toasted pineapple slices gave the Waikiki a different taste sensation and the Croc Dundee with the fried egg and beetroot was just an amazing meal. Mustn’t forget the onion rings and the ice cold Changs. My wife enjoyed her Blues Brothers (without the bun) and on other nights the chicken wings , chicken on green plate and those tasty chips.  There are still more gourmet creations to be sampled, another trip from OZ necessary, the YOLO remains a challenge to be tackled.  Great vibe in the restaurant, a warm welcome from staff and the elegant owner, impeccable unobtrusive service throughout. I’d recommend these burgers to anyone, they are just delicious taste combinations.

It does get really busy so would advise to book online before hand as we did see lots of people being turned away. I can recommend the beef cheek for main course.....amazing! We will visit again if we return to Phuket.

Hubby had the Jacket Daniel burger with a side of fries, it's definitely a gourmet burger. For dessert, I had the creme brulee, perfectly caramelised crust, creamy smooth custard. Hubby's dark chocolate mousse was also amazing. We loved it so much, before we left, we reserved a table for our last dinner in Phuket. Compliments to the chef, and Yanick as the maitre'd, and attentive waitstaff. This is the perfect place for a special night out. Try the Monaco beer cocktail.

(I don't know why they not include the 7% VAT on the price list, it looks a bit cheating for me) The decoration makes the easy place look nice and there is enough parking space around. Although it is a bit noisy because of the nearby main street (this takes off 1 point from ""excellent"" for me). Of course I will go there again - the food is really very good."

We were actually on the way to another restaurant, which was closed, when we decided to give this restaurant a try. It looked as if it had been recently renovated, as the tables and decoration looked fresh and tidy. The waitresses were attentive and always on the lookout to serve. The menu is small, but has a good enough selection of different dishes. We chose a salad and calamari as an appetizer, which were very nicely presented, but the taste of the salad sauce was just delicious! For main course I had the Paella, beautifully presented and extremely tasty and my wife the fish dish - very fresh and also delicious. We will be back soon again!

In fact they enhance the experience with their relaxed and friendly manner.  To the food. In a word amazing! From the amuse bouche, the appetisers, the main courses and ending with an imaginative dessert, all were of the highest quality. Our personnel favourites - the beef tenderloin, the lamb chops and the sea bass both cooked on salt blocks - were cooked to the highest standard and were mouth-wateringly good.  If you stay at the Anantara please visit this excellent restaurant.

Andaman Seafood Platter is highly recommended. So fresh and delicious - it was served with a sizzling Himalayan salt brick which made the food taste even better! Wagyu rib-eye was great too but we ordered medium-well, it turned out rare and bloody but truffle sauce really goes so well with it. The restaurant is located inside Anantara Mai Khao Villas so the price is sure to be expensive, but it is worth to spoil yourself once in a while.

The food: cooked on a salt block from Pakistan the fish or meats. I had the snapper which was beautifully cooked and presented. Location with a view of the ocean is breathtaking. Get there at least 30 minutes before sunset to enjoy the view of the water. They have indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor they do have fans and cover from the rain. Or, have a drink at the bar - good view also of the sea and yummy drinks (I had Fire on Ice...rum delicious!) Ask them to give you a buggy ride on the grounds at night...the lighting is not to be missed. It’s a beautiful resort. Tip: they have a Tree House bar. We didn’t have time to get this is but looks really cool. You can walk over from the Marriott via the beach or take a buggy. Can be a bit hard to find from the road especially. Hope you enjoy this evening. Only drawback is the service (i.e. presenting the menu) is not good. Probably not comfortable with their English. Otherwise it’s just fine!

I will start with the setting, which was lovely. Outside dining with blue and white tones, over looking the ocean (if you are there before sunset). Their online reservation system is VERY broken. We had a reservation for New Year’s Eve (we received an email confirmation) but when we showed up, they had no record of it. They informed us that they were not doing the menu that night and sent us on our way - where are you supposed to find another restaurant at 9 pm on New Year’s Eve? We decided to try again on January 2nd. Again made reservations online...and received an email confirmation. Got to the restaurant and they had no record of the reservation...at least this time they accommodated us. As I said before, a lovely setting. Our waiter had some struggles providing us with accurate menu information (actually was inaccurate on his description of several menu items) and overall the service was fair at best. If you are looking at their menu online - DON’T! It is not the same....and the menu at the restaurant was not descriptive - hard to know what you were going to get. We saw nothing served on a salt block. I am wondering if they have changed management or the menu compared to previous reviews - usually Trip Advisor is a good reflection of a restaurant- but not this time - look only at recent pictures and reviews! Most items were very overpriced! We had Tiger Prawn Cocktail - it was only 2 (two!) prawns and cost 750 Bhat! They were good, but really? We ordered two bottles of wine that were listed in the menu for 1700 bhat and we were charged 2000 bhat per bottle! As for main dishes- the ribeye was fair at best, the scallops were 4 scallops - very tender but otherwise very average...the best dish we had was the blue swimmer crab - 4 crabs, very tasty but a lot of work to eat. The Parmesan mashed potatoes were good, enough for two people. The Lobster Mac and Cheese? Not an accurate description at all...it was more of a pasta in a lobster bisque - no cheese to speak of. We ordered asparagus - sorry, they were out. So, I don’t usually tell people to avoid a restaurant - but we had much better meals and experiences in Phuket- eat elsewhere!

Sea.Fire.Salt is the premier eaterie at both Anantara and Marriott. It's more of a fine dining experience than other restaurants we ate at and it's fronted by the excellent, well travelled, French maitre d', Laurant. Who's a nice guy and very informative on your food and wine if you need him to be. First time here we had the mixed seafood brick (scallops, prawn, sea bass) and the mixed grill (lamb chop, steak, chicken) bricks. The searing hot Himalayan salt bricks are maybe a little bit of artistic licence and whether or not they contribute anything other than a hot, salty brick to your meal I wouldn't know. But they do make the difference of bringing something unique and interesting to the table. Food was very good, well presented with potato and vegetable sides. Handmade Sorbet deserts are delicious. As always in Asia, red wine served chilled, why do you do that? 2nd time we ate here was the last night of our stay, because it's a very nice place and it's nice being spoiled occasionally. Outrageously juicy Wagyu and Sirloin steaks served with a selection of salts that vary in colour, texture and taste, Very nice. I spoke to front of house when I arrived and was delighted when they managed to find me a non-chilled, perfect temperature bottle of red wine to enjoy with my steak. It completed my meal and I'm grateful for the efforts that were made. Food here is certainly not cheap, but it's good. Undoubtedly you're paying a little extra for the whole outdoor, on the seafront, well presented, himalayan brick, finer experience. Which I enjoyed. And I'd eat there again. Très Bien

The location and set up is very nice, and having a meal beside the beach with the crashing waves in the background is very romantic and soaking with atmosphere and style.  Service: The service was exemplary as expected at an Anantara. Attentive, helpful, and unobtrusive. They were kind enough to help move us inside to the air conditioned space which helped when it became too hot. They explained much of the dishes to us as well which was nice. When we left they got us a buggy to the reception and called our hotel and asked them to send a buggy to collect us. We were very impressed and pleased with this.  Food: The menu is very limited with only a few options for starters, mains and desserts. I was hoping for more seafood dishes and options. Their hallmark dish was seafood cooked on top of salt bricks. Heating the bricks and cooking it on top allows the seafood to absorb some of the flavour of the exotic salts. It felt gimmicky and I could not really taste any great benefit. I ordered the prawn version and it tasted like regular grilled prawns and was nothing special. I hoped to have some of the famous Thai flavours and passion reflected in the food. But I found the meal a bit bland. Don’t get me wrong, the food was fresh and all was very well executed but the mains were really not that interesting. The salt sommelier was there to assist with different types of salt to enhance your meal. I am a fan of interesting salts but again, this felt a bit forced. I could barely tell the difference between the salts and quite frankly, didn’t care. I just wanted to really good, tasty seafood. The starters were very good – most especially the rocket and pear salad which was quite WOW but a very small portion. The desserts were nicely made but nothing extraordinary. There was also a seafood feast but for the price, did not seem well worth it.  Price: This place was very expensive. I dont normally mind paying for good food but this felt unnecessarily expensive for what it was. I love Ananatra as a hotel and frequently dine at their restaurants even when I am not staying with them but the pricing of the is menu felt much too expensive for the food you were getting. Even if the price were lower, I would not be keen to come back again as I don’t find the food (except the salad) worth the inflated cost. It is a rarity that I do not like an Anantara establishment but the balance of value for money for atmosphere – made me feel disappointed.  I would not go back again for dinner as nothing interested my taste buds. I would not mind to have a drink or light snack there but as a dinner, I felt I could get better food, variety and price at one of the other dining options on the hotel property.

We decided to eat here after reading the reviews and it is in the next hotel along. I am so glad we did! We both said that it was the best meal we had eaten on the island.  We sat inside and all the staff were very attentive. I had a mocktail called Anantara which was lovely and my boyfriend had a glass of the Thai Shiraz which was actually good quality.  We didn't have starters but both had sea bass, mine on the rock plate and partners steamed. We were given 3 different salts to have with it which were explained and all went very well!  We had dessert too which was the best sticky rice and mango I've had on the island and we had the banana in coconut which was amazing.  The staff were lovely and the food fabulous. If you are in the Mao khao area it is definitely worth a visit, it's not the cheapest but it is worth the extra money!

We started the evening with their Brie Melters, which are pieces of Brie cheese deep-fried in a homemade batter. We paired the appetizer with a glass of Prosecco, currently on promotion.  Following this, we ordered the Lamb Stew and the Spaghetti Deluxe, in a rich red wine sauce. Sensational!  All-in-all, the quality of the ingredients, combined with the skilled knowledge of the kitchen brigade and the professionalism of the staff made this evening way more special than it should have been.  Highly recommended if you are in Kathu, or in Phuket Town.

The menu was broad and you’d be hard pressed not to find an interesting option. The salmon looked good, my mushroom spaghetti was really tasty, stroganoff looked huge. It ain’t cheap, but plenty of Phuket restaurants aren’t these days. It’s a slightly out of the way setting, but that’s ok. Finished with a very pleasant port...Oh, the cheeses were fine, but the accompanying biscuits....probably the only disappointment of the evening. The boss is in evidence, orchestrating the operation , he’s charming and runs it well.

While visiting Thailand, one has to eat the best Thai food, and of course, we looked at Trip Advisor to acquire its patrons' opinions. This restaurant rated No. 1, and had raving reviews. Given that, my husband, adult daughter and I decided to give Thong Dee, located in Kathu, relatively close to our hotel, a try. It is a relatively small restaurant located off the main road on what appears to be a neighborhood street. Given its size, I would recommend reservations, although we had no trouble making a last minute 7:30 p.m. on a Friday night. Our server was Patrick, and he could not have been nicer and knowledgeable about the food and wine choices, which are fairly ample (mostly Australian and New Zealand) and inexpensive for Thailand. From appetizers (my daughter and I had oysters and husband spring rolls) to our main course, the food was excellent! The wines were (New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and Shiraz) were paired well. The meal was well worth the money and time getting there, and service excellent. For us, it is a must to visit again the next time we are in Phuket.

Initially, there didn't appear to be a 4 seater table available ... but a fellow guest [on his own] volunteered to give up his table.

A cozy and comfortable cafe' with great guys, namely Dagistan and Moses(managers), running a spot easy to visit regularly when in the area. I stayed nearby with my daughter, and tended to drop by either day or night. Seating indoors and out, with friendly regulars, good food and a great location. I ate a great stuffed-chicken here, and my daughter had a shrimp dish once, an a lamb kebab. And she loved the fresh hummus and lemonade. I enjoyed dropping by in late evenings for rehydration and conversation with Dagistan. If you come earlier in the day you'll have Moses as you host. The guys can also ensure 'honest and fair' taxis from there. A nice place with nice people. I look forward to spending time here my next visit.

We were treated to some flavoured Pomegranate tea and nicely chilled slices of watermelon , free of cost , with compliments from the management. A wonderful ending to a delicious meal. Not to forget the warm hospitality and friendly nature of all the staff and owners there. Absolutely loved the experience and will highly recommend.

Now, after being there I'm positive it's the best place. Imagine dining on the terrace with Hagia Sophia just across you, at the same level, so you see its entire beauty. The restaurant is on the top floor of a building just across the famous Basilica cistern with direct views of Hagia Sophia. Although such places typically lack in service and food quality, I can assure you that service was great - very kind and fast and food was excellent. We took an array of Turkish starters and beef steak for a main. All were great, and entire bill along with drinks came around 60 Euros for two which I find quite reasonable. Place to recommend for a long lasting memory. TIP: make a reservation beforehand for outside seating by the fence.

After a long day touring the local sights in Istanbul, decided to dine at the “360 Panorama Restaurant”...a stone’s throw from the Hagia Sophia Museum and Blue Mosque. What a spectacular find! The views at sunset were breathtaking. The food: excellent! Try the lamb (tender and well spiced) and (grilled) Halloumi cheese salad for a succulent entree. Plenty of outdoor seating on a quiet roof top terrace 6 floors above the Main Street. Service: attentive and professional...never pushy. We dined here twice and loved it! This is a must try for dinner at sunset or a coffee/tea in the late afternoon.

We’ll have our last lunch there -we decided ( It sounded better than the “Last Supper”)so today after the Islamic Art Museum, our next and final stop was that restaurant. Since we were the only guests that time, it wasn’t hard to get the desired table, and after a few drinks, we started to feel human again. The waitress was very accommodating, and at my second Tonic water, she automatically put the three ice cubes into it. Feeling resurrected, I picked up my camera and started to take photos. The Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosques were so close that we were nearly able to touch them. My partner ordered Spaghetti Bolognese, and I Chicken with Mushroom sauce. Both of us found our food tasty, but my chicken just missed that magic touch, that makes a dish delightful. All in all, it is hard not to give this restaurant the five but I would prefer the 4.5 because of the quality of the food. Nevertheless, the extraordinary 5,5 service with the view makes it five altogether. The location of the restaurant is also excellent since it is a very short walking distance away from the most attractive sites in Istanbul. Price-wise it is somewhere in the middle, other places without that stunning view charge the same price. If you want to see the Golden Horn from above, this restaurant recommended.

The restaurant itself is also rather pleasant, and service is competent and good. I found the food to be absolutely average however. While perfectly acceptable, and a good place for a chat over dinner as the sun goes down over this fantastic city, one may be forgiven for not being too picky about the food. Based on a single experience I would reserve my judgement on the gastronomic quality of the place, and I would certainly recommend drinks and snacks here. But dinner was not one that I found remarkable.

The view here is stunning, overlooking pretty much all of Istanbul - panoramic views! We hadn't booked, but got a table on the terrace looking out over hagia Sophia museum. Waiters were efficient but took time to take our order as were having pictures taken with a group of Australian ladies! The food was good, we both had lamb and it was cooked really well , but nothing spectacular in terms of service or presentation of the food. We also tried a mojito - probably one of the worst I've tasted! I'd recommend for the views alone!

It's just a few minutes walk away from the Basilica Cistern and the Hippodrome and accessed through the And Hotel lobby.  When I arrived, there was nobody else in the restaurant, so the service was rapid and attentive. However, the dish I picked from the menu was off and I was steered towards one of the specials instead.  When this arrived, it was fine - a lamb dish - but I didn't much like the bed of sauce and vegetables it was on - but this is probably my problem as I'm not a big fan of vegetables!  The cost was fair and the staff were lovely - but the real draw for this place is the excellent panoramic views it offers.

But enough with the view, we're here to eat after all! And eat we did. This place has traditional Ottoman palace cuisine, which is simply decadent. We had lamb stuffed with pine nuts and raw almonds, which was so tender and tasty. We also had slow-cooked lamb wrapped in eggplant, which was melt-in-your-mouth good.

Mainly visited by tourists who should try other genuine Pottery kebab (that needs to be cooked inside for several hours, therefore need advanced order). We tried it in Cappadocia, we had to order it at least 3hr in advance. It was yummy.  Had lamb shank, it was hard. Even the knife couldn’t cut thru the meat.  Did we enjoy it? No. Do we recommend it? No.  It was very pricey too (for the quality of the food they served).

While visiting Istanbul, my wife and myself read reviews about this particular restaurant..  And have to say, we absolutely loved our culinary experience here..  We couldn't get a table booked online, so had to find our way to the restaurant and just hope we could get a table..  On arrival it was busy, and it was mostly local people eating here, not many tourists at time of our visit..  Very warm welcome from front of house and it's a warm, genuine greeting..  Absolutely NO ALCOHOLIC beverages served here, so if you want alcohol with your meal, then sorry, this isn't right place for you..  But if you want an authentic ambience, great welcome and really genuine Turkish food, then you'll enjoy eating here...  Not easy to find as it's slightly off the main area of tourist haunts..  One app that will help guide you through the streets to find this restaurant, put MAPS.ME on your phone...  No Internet requirement, as it uses GPS signal..  From Hagia Sofia Square, follow up the hill where the Trams go, find Burger King.. Turn left so BK is on your right... Follow this road down to a junction in the road.. The old Cistern is on left of junction..  There's a small road sharp right, don't take that road.. Take next right.. Follow down, to fork in road.. Keep left, keep walking and Restaurant comes up on your right...

We also preferred to go to a more special place, as opposed to a 'sidewalk' restaurant as had been the case for most of our trip. We deliberated between the tasting menu and ala carte, and in the end, went for the latter. We chose: 1. Tomato salad with goat cheese and walnut (probably the best salad we had ever had) 2. 'Pide' with beef ribs (so so yummy!) 3. Lamb skewers 4. Hand minced kebabs We were seated on Level 2 of the restaurant and even then, the service was pretty good. Highly recommend for a special night out.

We came to Era, because of it’s 5-star rating. What a disaster. Located in a “sexy massage” district old, almost dilapidated place that had not seen repairs for years. Waiters are disorganized and do not remember who ordered what and are slow. Our guy cracked a neck or the beer bottle with opener and still offered it to us and said he will bring a glass. He hesitated to replace the beer. Most importantly - food and drinks. If you order a gin and tonic and they have one type of gin only a place cannot be rated #1 in Hanoi (maybe 1001). My drink was horrible. Mushroom soup was edible. Fried squid had little squid in it. Mostly breading. Very limited menu for #1 place overall. We tried a lot better food here. So far I am very disappointed in Vietnamese cuisine - the menu is the same everywhere - pho or bahn me (sub sandwich).

Situated on the top floor of the stylish La Siesta Hang Be Hotel, there are many rooftop bars in the city but we found the cocktails here to be more adventurous than most.  The bar tenders/mixologists have really tried to come up with some unique flavours so as to capture the ‘feel’ of this exciting urban culture.  I tried the ‘Chef Inspired’ and ‘Guaranteed’: both enjoyable and unlike anything I’ve ever tasted before.  The views of Hanoi are spectacular and, on the floor below, is the ‘Cloud Nine’ restaurant which I have reviewed separately and loved. They also, of course, serve all the classics.  I would recommend trying this bar for some unique tastes.

In Lotte Saigon, they juice vegetables and fruits upon your request but I don't see it here, though. Eventhough fruits are available and juices were all displayed on the counter. The view from this restaurant is fantastic. Nothing beats a 63 floor view!

No need to book as only one other couple in the large restaurant. It looks like it is meant to be classy, situated on 63 floor of the Lotte building. Buffet looked ok but I never eat buffet. Had a Caesar salad by which I judge restaurants at lunchtime. My wife had a smoked salmon salad with pear (unfortunately the tasteless Chinese variety). The Caesar salad came deconstructed! I know this is a fashion but a deconstructed Caesar salad is just stupid. A little pile of Parmesan on the edge of the plate. How are you supposed to pick it up to put on the salad? A single white anchovy (too little) on another side instead of being mixed in the salad. Salad set in a ring of cheese crisp - ok as an idea but better if everything else there as well. The smoked salmon was ok and the bread was good. Dessert menu didn’t interest me - again too arty with poor flavor combinations that don’t mix. The bill took an age to come - longer than the food. So we went to Artisee in the Lotte shopping complex for chocolate cake and coffee to cheer me up.

You would expect this from a 5* hotel but the steak was exceptionally cooked and the risotto very tasty although slightly creamy. Wine was very good and matched our food - overall a great evening.  We paid roughly £95 which although I expected from a 5* hotel is very excessive and I think too pricey. I was personally expecting to pay more £70 however a good night, great food and good service - would recommend!

Unfortunately Grill 63 fails to deliver on any level of expectations.  Positives: Great space, Fantastic 360 degree views of Hanoi. Decent Rooftop Bar which feels like a copy of Bangkok's Sirocco Rooftop bar, (without the glitz or glam but with the same lofty prices)  Negatives: The produce for a 5 Star Hotel is terrible. (Shame on you F&B Director) you would get better food at your local pub.  The space whilst gorgeous, feels like a marketplace when the buffet is running. It's not helped by the many families that would bring children and let them loose to run around as if it's day care.  The service; well they try. Vietnam isn't going to get on Michelin's map any time soon, but the most simple place to start is service. Basic rules and attentiveness would go a long way. Perhaps the staff are equally distracted from the kids running around and focused on dodging them.  All in all, it doesn't work. There are better choices in Hanoi, close by.  But, the Rooftop Bar is worth a visit for a sunset during summer days.  Global MHA

Hold on to your wallet.	Let's get the good stuff out of the way first (I prefer writing positive things): The view is fantastic, as is most of the food presentation. The dining room is very well appointed. Some of the food (the risotto i.e. ) is very flavorful and a culinary delight .. but only some. The lava stone grill items we received looked super pretty, but tasted rather boring. Our waiter had recommended the same sauce to pretty much everything we inquired about. The value-for-money ratio here is .. well .. it is expensive ... this is a place less for foodies, but rather for people wanting to impress business partners or future parents-in-law. The atmosphere can be a tad stiff. What really bugged me was hearing wonderful Jazz music, unfortunately 2 different CDs from 2 different corners of the room (one was Sinatra, that much I could make out). And the last, unforgivable (but fixable) item: The free bread and butter: The butter is served in ugly single serve airline style packets (on a fancy saucer) and the bread rolls appear to be heated in a microwave, they turn to stone after 1 minute. Bottomline, I'll try again as long as someone else is paying for it ;)

For the second night, and after a very long day of touring the city, we decided to have dinner at The Red Bean. Greeted by friendly staff at the lift door, we were ushered to an intimate table and offered a menu with a great selection of dishes and drinks including cocktails. For cocktails we had: The Naked Man Pina Colada Both very moorish, so we had seconds at the end of our meal! We would recommend the spring rolls platter which had two fresh rolls, two crispy seafood rolls and two crispy Hanoi pork rolls. This was followed by a beautifully presented steaming bowl of pho. The pho at the restaurant was a delicately flavoured broth with rice noodles and tender beef. It was different to the rustic flavours you’d get from street food vendors and equally as wonderful. Every pho recipe has some hidden secrets and this was evident in the subtlety different flavours. Mango sticky rice wrapped up the evening and the warm coconut flavoured rice with sweet mango was everything that I was expecting and looking forward to trying for the first time. It was a great restaurant choice for our last night in Hanoi and if we are ever here again we will definitely visit.

There are three reasons to recommend this place: - First, food is top. Both Vietnamese and western options were super yummy. Me and my GF shared the Chef set menu and the Vietnamese set menu. TERRIFIC value. - Second, the place is on the 8th floor of the hotel La Siesta, and takes the whole floor. the views are great, the decor cute and everything is super clean. - Third, Paco is probably the best Maitre I have met in VN. He speaks Vietnamese, English, Spanish and a bit of Chinese. He truly cares about your menu selection, your wine and about your experience in general.

They made the reservation on our behalf and even escorted us to the restaurant - that is what I called 'good customer service'.  The Red Bean restaurant is situated at the foyer of the hotel and nicely laid out with a small bar. The ambience was good and the staff was attentive.  There is a lot to choose from the Menu, a combination of local Vietnamese and European food. As we have been in Hanoi for a few days and sampled quite a few local dishes, we decided to go for steak. We had tomato Rossini and fried vegetable spring rolls for our starters, followed by a tenderloin steak and a mushroom and aubergine claypot as our main courses. The food was gorgeous and very well presented. The portion size was just right for a fine dining. We had a flambe banana with ice cream and fresh fruit platter for our desserts.  We were not disappointed with the quality of food and service provided by yet another Le Siesta hotel which speaks volume for the Elegance Hotel Group. 3 of the EHG hotels have a Red Bean restaurants.  We were very pleased with our meal and thoroughly enjoyed our meal at the Red Bean and well done Le Siesta Diamond for recommending this restaurant.  Highly recommend that you give the Red Bean restaurant a go when you happen to be in the Old Quarter in Hanoi.  The Wise-Ones April 2019

Extraordinary good dinner and place! First of all, I enjoyed a lot the music set. Secondly, I enjoyed the Red bean set! :) It was a 5 course menu that included a bruschetta, salmon roll, mushroom soup, roasted duck breast and warm passion fruit cake with vanilla ice cream. It was just amazing! And only 25$! I would not recommend to take the Chardonnay by glass, it is not so good as it could be. I think the place is known by their cocktails, because the barmen were busy all the time and it seems that peope liked their creations judging by woops you hear around.

My wife and I had been traveling SE Asia for a month and enjoyed everything from Street food to Michelin star quality.  We where unsure where to try a 'high end' meal in Hanoi, after being given several inconsistent recommendations by previous visitors or tour guides.  For us, Cloud Nine fitted the bill perfectly and we enjoyed our first visit so much that we chose to return again on our final night in Asia.  Located in the La Siesta Hàng be Hotel, just below the rooftop bar (both reviewed elsewhere) its central to the Old Quarter but has far reaching views in all directions across the city. The decor is undoubtedly chic, with a hint of French presented with a wonderful Asian style and finesse.  They served a mix of Vietnamese and western food, although we only ate from the Vietnamese menu.  They offer a tasting menu at £17 per head but each night we chose to dine a la carte and spent a little more (approx. £25 excluding drinks) but the food, quality, preparation and presentation was absolutely first class.  What sets this restaurant apart though is the quality of service. Anyone who has traveled in SE Asia will know that, if you pay a little more, the quality of service is consistently good. Here it was truly exceptional.  From the very first moment, restaurant supervisor/ maitre d', Amber, ensures that you're welcomed, relaxed and served to your satisfaction. Not that she should have any concerns, as the staff are all, without exception, attentive and polite.  On both occasions we ate here, our server was Huyen. An absolute delight to deal with, her English was seriously impressive, indeed we found her easier to understand than some of our more heavily accented tour guides! She really exceeded any reasonable expectations of service.  On our return visit we were both treated like long lost friends and we'll take memories such as that away with us.  For the record, over our two visits, we ate the special chef spring rolls, Hanoi deep fried spring rolls, Phu Bo, asparagus and crab meat soup, Tom Yum Kung soup, green mango seafood salad, beef on hot stones and Tiger prawns in coconut. We never made it to dessert! In addition, they serve a complimentary amuse bouche to start and a refreshing drink to close.  A truly wonderful experience and I would highly recommend.

In fact, I cannot say this is a restaurant. It comprises of two rooms with tables and chairs on the first floor of a creepy building situated on an even creepier neighborhood, half an hour by car from the Old City. We arrived there at 7 PM. Our first belief was the taxi driver should have made a mistake, it seemed impossible to be a restaurant there. The neighborhood looked miserable, as well as the building we were in front of. A kid came and told us by gestures to go upstairs. We entered the ""restaurant"" and the first impression was very bad. At the end, the last impression was even worse. Let me summarize our experience there: - The owner was not there despite the fact we booked our table on day in advance, so he knew we will be there. No one else spoke English, so no communication was possible. - There were no waiters or waitresses. No personnel at all. - The kid invited us in the kitchen to see what snake we would have and eventually see how they kill it. I visited the kitchen (it would be better for me to not know how the kitchen looked like) but refused to see the slaughter. - To be fair, the owner called us and excused for not being there; his explanation was that he had to cook for his family. Great excuse! - It was supposed to have an 11-course dinner but we received only 9. - It was supposed to have snake wine to drink but the kid that served us brought only beer or coke. We asked for snake wine but he didn't (want to) understand our request. Eventually, I convinced the kid to call the owner and only I asked the owner for wine, the kid brought us a bottle. - Don't imagine this is a restaurant. It's a tourist trap. They don't accept credit cards, they don't give you any receipt. - The bill was 50 USD for two persons. Because we got there on our second day in Vietnam, we didn't know how big the bill was in comparison with other restaurants. After 14 days spent in various locations in Vietnam and eating only at restaurants, I can say the bill was HUGE! The next evening we went to the Essence Restaurant in Hanoi (the number 1 restaurant in Hanoi on TripAdvisor) and the bill for two persons was one-third (60% lower). - While we entered the taxi for going to the hotel, the kid ran after us waiving the money we paid. Only after the local taxi driver told him that the amount of money is right, the kid cooled down.  About the food: the only two good dishes were the two types of soup. Being the first time we had snake, we did't know what to expect for. Either the meat was badly cook or not, the taste was not good. Some dishes were not cooked well, i.e. the pieces of meat were dry and over-roasted. It looked like many dishes served were composed of leftovers. They didn't look like fresh cooked. We didn't find another place in Vietnam with such dull and bad food.  About the snake wine: IT IS NOT a wine!! I don't know why they are calling it ""wine"". It is a spirit, a fermented alcoholic beverage in which they put a snake. It is not very strong, maybe 25-30 ABV. I didn't like the taste. I tried it again on a day-trip to Mekong Delta and the taste was the same. It was not my style.  In a nutshell: go there only if you don't care about your money, about what you eat and how you are served. Elsewhere, go to any other place."

I was a bit apprehensive as to the many dishes which were brought before us, but enjoyed tasting all...even the penis soup! Washed down by snake wine (6yrs old)….Free beers and sodas were offered throughout the meal and the staff were attentive, but also left us to enjoy our meal....(we were the only ones in the restaurant) and made to feel very welcome. You could handle the snake if you wanted...not too scary! And choose which kind of snake you wanted for lunch.Great experience and would definitely recommend it for an ""out there"" experience, but still within enjoyment levels! Even my mum enjoyed it!

This restaurant was around the corner from our hotel, and based on T/A reviews, we decided to give it a try. It was a truly memorable experience. At first we were the only people there, however it was early and very soon the restaurant was full. We were served by Tamy, a real character who made many jokes and entertained us with a selection of buddha figurines that he brought to the table. Each day after our initial visit, he would spot us walking by and run out to greet us and ask if we needed any help with sights or directions etc. A really lovely person, with excellent English.  The food also was very good. I had a beef stew, which was really delicious, whilst others had more western fare such as burgers, pizza, club sandwiches etc - all very good. The restaurant seemed to mainly attract tourists, however don't let this detract you. It is a really welcoming, lovely space with a wonderful atmosphere and pretty outlook. You won't be disappointed.

Dinner for two on the terrace. Vietnamese card: 3/4 choices only.  We took Nems to share and Bun cha (grilled pork and noodles) and cha ça (fish) in dishes plus a bottle of Chilean chardonnay wine.  Very nice waitress but not speaking a word of English and a beginner for sure! She introduces us to another Chilean Sauvignon wine. The domain name being the same she did not understand! We are then offered another chardonnay twice as expensive (1,250 ok) but it is not cold!! So ice cubes in the glass … (it does not matter we are on vacation)  Passable culinary quality. Big surprise ! We did not know that the accompaniments of the 3 dishes were identical.  When paying...nobody know how to debit an Amex card. Everything ends very well with a smile because they are kind staff.  This note is for the GM. Where is the management and staff training?  Fortunately all our other discoveries in Hanoi were fantastic

We had spring rolls, mango salad, soups, hot stone beef stew, fried chicken and fresh fruits.  We also had lunch on two occasions which were equally good and we have lighter dishes from the menu.  Service was excellant and staff were attentive. Food was well presented and delicious.

So i decided to go with Rice Noodle with nugget and fried tofu. The presentation of the dish was great too.  While i was eating, I accidentally drop my chopstick.

I would definitely visit this place again when i have a chance to go back to Hanoi.

I had slow cooked pork, which I hadn’t eaten for years. I reckon that it is one of the traditional Vietnamese dishes that are served with a small pot. When I was in Hue, I ate this kind of dish a lot. It is delicious but I wish they had a wider range of food (menu).  They have Vietnamese wine as well as Italian, French and Chilean wine but unfortunately Vietnamese wine is by the glass only. If you want to try Vietnamese wine, you have to order a bottle. Some wine is available by glass. Besides wine, there are many kinds of cocktails.  I should have asked if I could play piano ( Yes they have piano on the 2nd floor )  It is a very lovely setting.

Very earnest young man among a great staff who would make you feel very welcome.  Overall great food, generous portions and excellent service.  P/S: we forgot to take a picture of the chicken.

We had an amazing time and were able to order a wide variety of items off of the menu. Everything was prepared artfully and tasted quite good and authentic. I don't recall the exact item, but the prawn dish I had was excellent. The old colonial building was just the right amount of restored and rough with bare brick, exposed beams and old photos. We don't typically eat so high-end--and let's face it: healthy--when traveling but the occasion was perfectly served here. Service was friendly and efficient and loved the semi-hidden location in a lantern-strung alley.

Amazing food with amazing staff who explained everything about the meal I picked. Mia who served me was so attentive and taught me how to prepare my main course of Grilled 'Lang' fish (number 11).  The interior of the restaurant was delicately decorated and it was a peaceful experience from starter to finishing dinner with a ginger and orange tea.  It was a shame this was my final night in Hanoi but when it comes to eating, I saved the best until last.

We had spring rolls, claypot pork belly, mango salad, duck, etc. The dishes were generally above average (6.5/10) except for the duck meat (4.5/10) as its meat was tougher than we thought. Prices are reasonable too. Finding the restaurant may be challenging too as it is located in a tiny side cul-de-sac.

Had dinner on the weekend in this nice restaurant which was playing hoast to a party of perhaps 14 people including two very loud and rambunctious boys.

It is an expensive and nice restaurant by Hanoi standards so I did not expect to be subject to a hour of regular high pitched screaming and much running around.

I happened to be in the area and checked my TripAdvisor app to find a place for dinner. When I realized that I was only five minutes away from the #1 spot in Hanoi (according to TripAdvisor), I needed to try it. At first, as someone who lives in Hanoi, I was turned off by the idea that it's almost on Hoan Kiem lake. I thought it would be a tourist trap. It's not. And, the fact that you have to go down a tiny little alley and up a flight of stairs just adds to the awesomeness of the experience. From that alley, you emerge into a bright, cheerful and welcoming little shop. There's great outdoor seating if the weather is good and there's cool, clean air conditioning inside if that's your fancy. The staff was incredibly nice and talked me through the process for selecting my bowl. It was absolutely delicious. And, the fresh orange carrot juice was great too.  And, one of the key reasons that I'm giving this place 5-stars (and not just because everyone else seems to) is that they are also very ecologically aware. They offer bamboo straws, bamboo chopsticks and wooden spoons. All of the cutlery was therefore biodegradable or reusable. I loved that. Oh, and the juices were in reusable glass bottles.

Certainly not one of the top meals on our Trip. The drinks were made by a bartender who had no clue how to make simple mixed drinks like putting sprite in a martini. The atmosphere on the other hand was great.

Very first restaurant once we arrived in Marrakech and it was a good start. Despite of the fact that we had chosen French Cuisine we did not regret this. All dishes were cooked to perfection and the choice of fresh herbs and spices was excellent. We had lobster for starter to be continued with a great steak in a kind of Bernaise gravy. Was delicious. The hosts are very friendly and even the Maitre appeared at the table to ask for feedback. Well done. I finished that meal with a Cafe Gourmet which was a good choice. The only cons was that inside of restaurants in Morocco it is still allowed to smoke, a pitty especially in restaurants like this where you want to discover all tastes. Finally, we strongly recommend this place for sure and advice you to have a reservation in advance.

This place could be Michelin rated. After travelling around Morocco and putting up with the monoton for 2 weeks, it was an absolute treat to enjoy some real, thought out French food. Every plate was really delicious. The service was great too. Highly recommend, definitely the best meal we had in Morocco.  They had a big selection of wines, but the cocktail menu was very uninspired (Morocco..).

Was a little odd to be in the restaurant side though, while football was on and people just drinking at the side of us in the bar, watching the large TV.

Great choice of drinks.  Would def return and recommend.

They have a complicated 'formula' tapas menu but we just ordered one tapas dish each plus some wine. The red wine was really good although some were served chilled which I also noticed in another bar in Marrakech. The servers were very friendly and efficient and the food arrived quickly. When some of us returned the next night the waiter recognised us and although it was busy he made sure we were seated quickly and served us well. Great atmosphere, great music, although a little too loud to allow for easy talking on a Saturday night bur we really enjoyed our time here.

It is our last evening in Marrakech and we decide to go to Le Baromêtre. It is about 2.5 km walk from the Medina, but taking a cab is not unwise because the restaurant is quite difficult to find....  But when you have found it, you enter a great entourage, inspired by the period of the reclamation in America. Alcohol was forbidden, but it was drunk in illegal cafes in cellars!  We start in the bar, where two gentlemen make some spectacular cocktails for us. Definitely not cheap, but just the experience of watching is worth it!  Then to the restaurant. We take different starters and main courses and everything is equally great. Excellent dishes, highly flavored, attentive and friendly service! Because of the cocktails, the food, the service and the entourage we had a super evening!  We wonder why Michelin has not found this restaurant yet!

Found out about this little gem on TripAdvisor and I was not disappointed. Almost missed the entrance as it’s very low key. The doorman has to ask us if we were looking for it. It’s in a basement. It’s dark and moody. The bar is great in a small space which makes it personal. The service was quick, friendly and exceptional. The music was really good. The restaurant is through another door and has the exact same qualities. Really really well thought out. The food is simple and from a manageable menu. A had the beef fillet. It was tender and juicy. Lots of flavour. The only thing I would say is maybe more vegetables with it. All that really accompanied it was puréed potato. My partner had the lamb shank. It was a good portion and full of flavour but again, maybe adding more vegetables as it was only accompanied by potato purée. For dessert we had tiramisu and apple pie. At the end we were given a complementary drink. The experience was excellent. I really recommend this place.

The place is rather small and in a basement. The neighborhood it lays in doesn't really reflect the inside.  Without a reservation you will be seated in the bar area, the music is rather loud but not a nuisance. If you'd like to dine calm I'd advice to make a reservation.  The staff is helpful, but the door keeper at the entrance isn't like, welcoming.  We ordered a 2 cocktails and some food. The cocktails are nicely presented, but as you'll learn in Morocco lots of alcohol. I felt that the mix of the Aperol Spritz was missing and the taste was overkill by the overkill of Aperol. Bellini isn't as nice as the original, not bad but misses that typical martini taste.  Food, portions are rather small and it's adviced to order a dessert or entree if you have more hunger. The wait time is rather long (+-45 minutes) so calculate that in.  Overall I had a mixed feeling. My appetite was a bit gone by the burning smell of some cocktails and the loud music. Tastes of the food are good, but there are better places in Marrakech where you can eat the same for less money. Cocktails are fine if you can handle the alcohol.  Might had a different experience if I sat in the restaurant part.  Finally, the price. It's comparable to European restaurants. We paid for 2 cocktails and 2 dishes 600 dirhams (around 60 euro)

After a week of tagine and couscous, it was wonderful to find a restaurant in Marrakech that served foie gras (poelee), confit de canard, filet de boeuf, lamb chops etc. The decor is quirky, with a “pseudo-industrial” feel, but the staff are efficient, enthusiastic, and all speak good English. The prices are not cheap, but the food quality is outstanding, so one leaves highly satisfied. We are not cocktail fans, but this is clearly a major attraction of this restaurant, indeed many people apparently come here just to drink them. The couple at the table adjacent spent several minutes photographing their cocktails before drinking them!

Once inside there is a dark and cosy bar preparing a large selection of cocktails. We were greeted by a friendly member of staff who showed us to our table. Restaurant wasn't full when we arrived but soon all tables were gone. Food was amazing!! I had lamb while my boyfriend opted for beef both were equally as nice as the other. The only criticism I would have is that there was no veg with my lamb and there wasn't the option to order any. Dessert were yummy too. Cocktails and wine what more could you want. Staff were very attentive and made our experience a special one..

It doesn’t look pretty at the entrance, though, but don’t get discouraged. Nice and professional staff. The only thing I’d change was the music :/ the covers of pop songs played there take the charm away, yet my friends loved it. To each their own ;) The food tasted GREAT and was served with mint tea and a big bottle of water included in the price.

The only problem was the waiting: there was only one waiter, so a lot of time passed between a serving and the other. Still appreciated the dinner

Definitely a must go! Near the city center, easy to miss entrance, but that’s part of its charm. Used to be a family house. The waiter Anas has been very kind and efficient.

The entrance was a bit confusing but once in, there was plenty of comfortable seating. The interior was unusual in structure, possibly a courtyard but now with a covered roof. The staff were all polite, efficient and cheerful. We chose the 3 course menu, excellent value at 80dh per person. The soup was hearty and the main tagine courses were piping hot and tasty. We finished the meal with fruit and mint tea. Would recommend this restaurant to any visitors to the city.

We didn't linger, the vibe wasn't for us, but the food and service was really good.

Let me put it this way: a nice dinner that evening including cat entertainment. Palette is the star of this restaurant. Straying around the tables you get a visit from here once food is ready. What a funny moment. On our arrival she started her nap at the table next to me. In the moment the starters arrived she immediately woke up and started to „check“ what is going on there. We loved it. Let me get to the starters. The homemade foie gras I choose was delicious but slightly overpriced. 21 Euros for one single slice is too much. Even at Michelin rated restaurants the portion would be better. The main course was great, nothing to complain about. Good usage of spices and herbs, was a nice dish and good eventing. We can recommend this place.

Candles on the tables. Charming staff served us drinks, wine and an excellent meal, in pleasant ambience. Only minor downsides were nearby smokers, and slightly over-loud music. Can recommend the ""burnt"" avocados, coming with prawns on sticks, and also the mains of lamb shank (cooked 7 hours), and the monkfish on the bone, coming with curry sauce and risotto. Fabulous.

The food was European style with middle east twist in the flavors and way to cook. Having a curfew at nine a clock doesn’t help the business but it’s a great place to go if you want to try something contemporary in marrakech.

We chose this restaurant for our last night in Marrakesh. We followed the signs from the main street Rue Zitoun Kedim and went through an area where local youngsters were hanging out and playing football and we thought we were lost. We then spotted a sign for the restaurant again and a member of the staff, dressed in a hooded cloak escorted us to PepeNero. We hadn't booked in advance, but after a few minutes, a lovely table was found for us, right opposite the ornamental pool shown on the photo in the restaurants' Tripadvisor profile. We were looked after by Mr Khalid and the service was quite formal but very professional and friendly. We had a lovely meal and enjoyed the evening. It was the most expensive meal we had during the week, but we would definitely return and recommend to others. Just to mention, that when we left the restaurant, those same youngsters approached us and insisted that the route we were taking was closed off (despite people coming from that direction) and they would show us an alternative route. Fortunately we had Google maps open so we could see they were taking us completely the wrong way. We were warned that this could happen so we were prepared. Would advise planning your return route before leaving or asking the staff for directions back to your accommodation.

One of the charms of this restaurant is its location, around a 10 minute walk from the main square through some interesting back streets (mind the speeding mopeds). The restaurant send great directions but if you're a little nervous about finding Pepe Nero they will send someone out to the square to collect you.  The food was delicious and the service was perfect. We chose from both the Moroccan and Italian menus and our friends agreed this was a real gem of a place. Great atmosphere, food and service and the prices are amazing.  So glad we came back and having informed the restaurant at the time of booking that it was our anniversary they supplied a lovely complimentary cake at the end of our meal.  I cannot speak highly enough of this establishment - top class

The only downside, is that smoking is allowed in the restaurant so someone could be smoking next to you while you are eating.

It's in the original courtyard of the Riyad and offers both traditional Moroccan and Italian food as the Riyad is owned by an Italian family. You can mix and match courses from both menus as I did. The vegetables are grown on the family's own land outside of Marrakech and are delicious. The restaurant is not that easy to find as its down a tiny back street but it it signposted from the square. The courtyard is beautifully elegant with a lovely water feature. Food and service were outstanding and they serve alcohol even in Ramadam. The restaurant is run by the same efficient,friendly guy who is the senior manager of the Riyad. We were staying at Al Moussika so saved this restaurant for our last night and we weren't disappointed. Some reviews said it was priced but we didn't think it was bearing in mind the far superior quality of food and drink on offer. I had aubergine parmegiana to start and then shared theslow cooked lamb with my husband - delicious. I would 100% recommend this restaurant.

We were not disappointed.  The setting is wonderful, with beautiful decoration throughout. The staff were very attentive, pointing out little steps and filling out drinks throughout service.  My wife went for the Italian options whilst I went for the Moroccan. Both of us enjoyed our food immensely. The salads were delightful and each stood out as a well prepared/cooked dish. My beef tagine easily being the best I've experienced during my visit, with the meat falling away at a touch. My wife with her Italian dishes assured me the aubergine parmigiana was the best she's had, out of several trips to Italy and excellent restaurants. The pasta dish she had was also great.  Where I feel this missed out was that dessert was not great, but just ok. The dishes were decorated with chocolate and raspberry coulis, which tasted more like sauce for ice-cream. Finally, the service once we had finished seemed to disappear, as it took us quite a long time to get their attention to get the bill. By the time we did, we had both gone off the idea of getting a coffee to end the meal with.  So very close, but otherwise this is a great restaurant with some excellent cooking.

If you're vegetarian, remember to mention this, as they will bring you an amuse bouche with meat in, if you don't. The prawn starter is tasty, but I'd definitely recommend the smoked salmon tartare with avocado and balsamic vinegar, really tasty. The cheesy tortellini is also yummy. Although this restaurant is a little hidden away, there are plenty of signs to point you in the right direction from the main square.

As simple as that.	It's a convoluted route to get to Pepe Nero, but what a glorious experience when you arrive. We had a week in Marrakech, and this is far and away the best restaurant - infinitely better than the posh restaurants around the main squares and far, far better than the supposedly typical Moroccan eateries within the expensive hotels. It's Italian cooking, and Moroccan cooking - two menus; you take your choice, or mix and match from both. The chef trained in London and Italy, and brought his expertise here. The food is very good, the wine even better (feel free to ask if you can taste before you choose, and the extremely helpful waiters will oblige) and the setting sublime, with rose petals in the central fountain, handy loos off the huge courtyard, interesting little atmospheric side rooms and up-and-down, higgeldy-piggeldy steps and corridors everywhere. Housed within the Riyad al Moussika in Derb Charkaoui, it took us about 20 minutes to walk to the restaurant, down a series of winding alleyways and streets, following the black signs, from Jamaa el Fna. However, it only took us 5 minutes to get back at the end of the evening, as we were allowed to leave via the kitchens and a secret back route! The food is excellent. I began with salmon tartare, the only criticism being that some of the avocado pieces in the assemblage weren't totally ripe. My bride had a starter of warm aubergine - a bit like Turkish aubergine dishes. My main course was tortellini - home made in a rich, creamy parmesan sauce. My bride opted for risotto with shrimp. All dishes top-notch, and very filling. The service is terrific, with sparky, cheeky waiters who love a bit of banter. This is a restaurant to enjoy and experience. Pre-booking essential as it, understandably, sells out most evenings. We had an excellent bottle of Moroccan wine - a 2016 Medaillon cabernet for around £25. Total price for two, including water and service, was about £80 sterling equivalent. If this restaurant was in the UK or Europe, it would be 'bib gourmand' status in the Michelin ratings.

WOW. WOW. WOW.  I was stunned by the image of this restaurant. A beautiful lay out, not too loud.

The inside of the riad was so beautiful. The staff was friendly. The food was SO good. I sampled the salmon, beef fillet, lamb, and duck breast. It was all delicious. The duck was amazing. We also had the creme brûlée. We didn’t have traditional Moroccan food, but it is on the menu. Great prices. If you are in the area, you must try this place!

It is located not far from Jemaa El Fna/Bahía Palace but the area does not look so safe (be careful)  What it is sure is that, reading the reviews on the internet, I expected something more.  In my opinion, it is an on-average restaurant, with dishes from both the Italian and Moroccan cuisine.

Unfortunately, it wasn't as good as expected. Ravioli with white parmesan sauce was filled with... yellow cheese, making it all very chewy. The service was rather impersonal and only the surrounding stunned us. They definitely have better marketing than they can deliver in terms of running good restaurant.

Perhaps it was the side room we were seated in (however it was nice and quiet in there).

Tables are situated around a pool and a central marble courtyard with a mosaic clad fountain. A large speaker provides some cool background beats. The restaurant offers two menus – Moroccan and Italian – with the ability to mix and match both. The latter offered a welcome break from the traditional tagines. The king prawns with diced tomatoes and cocktail sauce and the eggplant mozzarella for starters were both beautifully seasoned and bursting with flavour and the home made fettucine and tortellini parmesan cream for main brought back fond memories of some of the best Italian pasta houses. There is an extensive wine list although the Moroccan wine is slightly on the expensive side. The only downside was the service which can best be described as unfriendly and unengaging and we felt a little rushed with courses arriving quickly when we had indicated we would like a break or, in the case of the bill, unprompted. It was slightly odd to be taken to a back room to pay the bill by credit card but I had nothing to fear in that all of the staff were extremely courteous and polite. This was our stand out favourite restaurant during our nine night stay in Marrakesh and we cannot wait to return.  Tip: Ignore the young men waiting to greet you when you leave the restaurant who will seek to persuade you to follow them on a different route back to the main square on the basis that the conventional route is closed at night. This is a standard ruse at this (and many other) locations and an attempt to fleece you of your hard earned dirhams……

We shared Moroccan salads (the falafels were very dry), Briouate and Chicken Pastilla which we enjoyed more in other places - but the chicken skewers and chicken wrap were enjoyed by our teenagers.  To be fair, it was only 340DH for a family of five, which was good value.

First time had harira soup with bread and both the soup and the bread were really nice so decided to come back for dinner. And I’m sad to write this review but the dinner was disappointing. My mum’s chicken and veg tajine and my chicken pastilla were very dry. My pastilla was so dry I got tired chewing it. There was no sauce whatsover in my mum’s tajine. The flavours were there but it was just so unpleasant to eat dry meat. When asked, I told the waiter the meat was dry and he offered to bring a new one, I had eaten half of my pastilla and wasn’t hungry anymore and I didn’t have hope that another plate of the same food will he any different so I declined his offer. Customer service and music were nice and so was the soup, so go there for that and stay away from meat dishes.

We emailed Paula when we arrived and booked in for the 2 course lunch and pool day for 290DH, included in the price are your sun loungers, towels, afternoon tea/snack and a sun hat! We also organised transfers for 150DH each way. We loved it so much, that we emailed them to book in again a few days later. However, there was a school group booking on the day we wanted so they emailed us to let us know in case we wanted to avoid that day, which goes to show, they wanted us to have a nice relaxing day and not just take our money for a day at the pool - well done!  The food was absolutely delicious and a good portion size. The service was excellent albeit we had to wait a long time for dessert, which was worth the wait!  The infinity pool is huge and very clean, although not heated, which is a great cool down in the heat. MLT really is a beautiful, clean, friendly place to have a chilled day at the pool, if we return to Marrakech we would consider staying here. Highly recommended.  Make sure you book in advance and I would recommend booking the return transfer service for 150DH each way.

For 290DH we got two delicious courses each, and use of the pool all day - this also included towels and a late afternoon snack.  The food was absolutely delicious - some of the best we had in Marrakech - and the service went above and beyond. We were there celebrating my birthday and my partner was able to arrange a bottle of champagne with the owner, which they didn't have on their wine list. Nothing was too much trouble and we had a fantastic day.  One thing to note, the pool isn't heated, but that actually makes for a welcome respite from the hot sunshine. It really is a tranquil environment and a fabulous place to have a relaxing day. If we had known about Manzil La Tortue when we were booking our accommodation, we would have definitely booked to stay there. Highly recommended.  Top tip: If you wish to do their pool and lunch day and you're staying in central Marrakech, call up and book their transfer service (costs 150DH each way) to avoid the inevitable haggling with the taxi driver once you arrive!

Eventually found it was behind the Café de France east side of main square, along the alley beside and 100m further on. Small, but with an upper deck, seating 10 tables. Sadly, this was accessed by a very tight spiral staircase, not very suitable for the elderly. Unfortunately, it was pretty full and the service slow. People weren't even served in order. No alcohol, but some nice fruit juices. Decent Moroccan salad starter. The chicken tagine was ok even if the vegetables were overcooked, but the cous cous (also in a tagine) had seriously overcooked, almost unrecognisable, soggy vegetables, and was nearly bereft of its supposed chicken. The one saving grace was that it was very cheap. Not rushing back.

Also the entourage - both the rooms as well as how they serve the dishes - is more than just a snack bar. They also have a floor upstairs but we didn't check that out as it is much more fun to stay close to the street where things happen. The staff is polite, multi-lingual (French, Spanish as well as English) and attentive. This is certainly a good stop for a small meal.

We had the tagine of beef, prunes and almonds / very tender and tasty and the chicken pastilla / sweet and fragrant. Moroccan sweets were ordered to complete the meal. The meal was value for money.

Recommended by our hotel, we had high expectations, bit at the same time a bit afraid it would be more a scenic restaurants to please tourists eager to get an exotic feel than a gastronomic experience to remember. Unfortunately we were not wrong. Depending on the dishes, the food between good and very good, not the best in the neighbourhood. But the worse part was definitely the service. After we were seated we waited for about 20 min before the menu was brought o us and whenever the dishes were served it seemed the waiter was always giving instructions to other rather than paying any attention to us (and looking at other tables this seemed to be the norm in the place). Overall a good experience in a fabulous setting, but could have been much more.

The food and decor at this place are excellent, with live musicians in the front room. This place is a little gem. It’s very unfortunate that it is hard to find and if you are not accompanied by a guide or a local, you are followed by a mob of very aggressive teenagers who harass and threaten you until you give them money. We had a staff member from the restaurant standing a couple of meters this happened who just watched and did nothing to help. This is frankly appalling from the restaurant staff. The restaurant knows full well that the mob outside is vile and aggressive and they know the place is very hard to find on your own, but they didn’t offer to come pick us up from our Riad or anything when we called to book a table. It’s only when we complained on arrival that they offered that one of the waiters walked us back to our Riad after the meal. We give 1 star just because of this incident. Moroccan police don’t seem to care about these sort of things and the restaurant turns a blind eye. We will never return and we advise people to go either with a taxi or accompanied by a local for safety.

When we made the booking through its official site, we were impressed by the fact that not only got a reconfirmation at once (this is plus) but also they arranged someone from the restaurant to meet us at a gate and escort us to it. Obviously the reason of that was that we had to walk for 10 minutes in ""suspicious"" dark narrow streets only with locals around. Upon arrival we were proposed to have a drink on the roof top (quite indifferent place) where we had to wait for 40 minutes our drinks to arrive. Pretty hungry we decided to go down stairs for our dinner. The salads (a variety of local preparations that they call salads with beans, pumpkin and much more unknown items ) were not tasty. The main dishes were poor and mixed up my order as the waiter's English were poor. After being complaint about dish which was not the desired one and having wait for another 20 minutes, they delivered to me again the a wrong order. It was then when I realized that I had to eat a snack at the hotel on the way back. Did not like the ambiance (too dark) and ........ The only positive was that someone escorted us back to the gate on the way out and managed to escape from there. SORRY BUT ..... NO RECOMMENDATION SHOULD BE GRANTED TO THIS RESTAURANT Missed to mention that they offered complimentary a kind of desert for the inconvenience"

TIP: they may ask if you want to go to the rooftop for a drink. If it's cold, the entire thing is tented up, so you see absolutely nothing, i.e. no view of anything. It's quite a few steps to get there, so if you are not inclined to do some random exercise, skip this.

We came here during our stay in Marrakech, and it was great although a little difficult to find at first. It's really good when you fancy something that is less traditionally Moroccan and we chose to go for two pizzas, a chicken one (45dh) and a vegetarian one (50dh), both of which were really good however by the end you started to notice the dough was quite sweet which made it difficult to finish it all. The price was really good and they had a great selection of juices and soft drinks which were also really nice. You also got bread and dip before your meal included in the price with no additional cover charge. The service was really good and prompt too and the lady who served us spoke good English and was very polite. The restaraunt was clean and we would recommend going here for sure.

It is not easy to find inspite on the mail road. It opens at 1.00pm and closes 10.00pm. It is closed on Wednesday. There were two small tables on the ground floor with the main open kitchen behind them. On the first floor there were10 small tables for 4 people each.  Be prepared to wait a while as the food is freshly prepared. It is worth the wait as the food is delicious. I have been there on two occasions and on both time there was only one waitress who spoke very good English and was rushed off her feet. The local dish which I chose called Tajine was lovely. I chose a Tajine chicken which had fresh vegetables - runner beans, potatoes, carrots, olives (photo enclosed). This was my first Moroccan dish and I was not disappointed.  On the second time I had a freshly made pizza and it was just as enjoyable as the traditional Moroccan dish. Everything on it was fresh and it tasted wonderful. It tasted better than the ones that I had in Rome and Sicily.  This little restaurant gets very busy. I would highly recommend going early as possible otherwise there can be an hour waiting time. Diners do seem to be in a hurry to leave.  You will not be disappointed as it is a great place to enjoy home cooking at a very reasonable price.

There are definitely nicer tagines in Marrakesh but you will still have a good meal if you choose to eat here.

There are only 24 seats, mostly on the mezzanine area. It appears basic but noticeably clean and tidy. The menu is a blend of Moroccan and international with everything from pizzas, pastas, burgers, salads, traditional Moroccan, crepes, soups. I enjoyed a really good home made courgette and vegetable soup followed by spaghetti bolognese and fruit salad and mint tea (served with complimentary Moroccan biscuits/pastries). As it got busier there was pressure on the speed of service - but I was in no hurry - but all through there was a pride and passion for what was being served and how it was presented. Very inexpensive, an extensive menu and caring service made this place instantly likeable. Good on ya Yassine!"

When we arrived at around 8.30pm they put up the closed sign, saying they were full, but they said we could come back after half an hour. We sat at an outside table and had some juice while we waited and were then invited in. Our tagine order was taken promptly (our first choices were not available) and, while we waited, we were served breads and olives and dips, which were delicious. The 'meat' tagine was tasty though the meat was very fatty. Our table was cleared quickly but no one came near us after that; there were five, then four tables in use upstairs and the waiter brought dishes to the table near the top of the stairs several times but made avoiding eye contact into an art! After about three quarters of an hour we, and one of the other diners, got fed up and went downstairs to settle our bills and leave. The restaurant is extremely basic, but that was OK; the food we got to eat was very good but the service was just off-putting. The two people in the kitchen looked busy but we would have been happy to wait for desserts if someone had just glanced over to see if we wanted anything. Really disappointing experience

We stumbled across his restaurant by chance at lunchtime. They were busy so we joined the small queue and waited for 15 minutes. They gave us a glass of complementary fruit juice as we waited which was lovely. In summary this place is excellent! The staff were very friendly and efficient. The food was really excellent, tasty, hot and inexpensive. I recommend trying the specialty dishes, ours were great. We hope to go again tomorrow. Try it, you won’t be disappointed.

Welcome smoothies and smiles each time. On that note - do make reservations as you may be turned away if they're fully booked which was almost every night.  Tagine and couscous were some of the best we had. Prices are super reasonable, portions are more than enough, and their whiskey (Moroccan mint tea) was always yummy.  Pay them a visit!

Firstly, make a reservation beforehand otherwise you’ll be in for a long wait. Also, unless you’re really famished skip the starter because the portions are large so you’ll probably struggle to finish it. Because they’re usually busy expect a long wait for the food.

Went for dinner when in Marrakesh after having read other reviews. Didn't regret a bit! We didn't reserve and were really lucky we came early (around 7pm) to get a table. Many people came in after us and were turned down. Do make a booking. It's cosy inside, the service was fantastic, both manager and waiters were checking from time to time if everything was ok. Actually everything was more than ok - so delicious! Try their pastilla - thinnest filo pastry almond and chicken pie - it's so good. I've had the Gazelles tagine sweet/salty, loved and ate everything. Reasonable priced - our bill for 2 people based on main course, 2 mint teas and 1 starter shared came to 230 Dirhams that is equivalent to £18. Like most other restaurants in town, unless it's a hotel, they don't serve alcohol. It's not far from Jamal el-Fna so when you've had enough of wandering about, it's a great place o recharge the batteries.

Fruit salad comes accompanied by two pieces of Moroccan pastries. Waiters are pleasant, speak English and French and the service is efficient. Overall, an enjoyable experience.

I stumbled upon this place and, lucky for me, I ended up with a fantastic Beef Tagine that easily became the highlight of my day. The serve was a bit lacking, but mainly due to the prime time of dinner. Let's face it, I didn't have anywhere else to be anyway.  The restaurant is colorful and charming and very well priced. Note that this place takes cash only, so no cards. Euro and local currency only. I'll gladly come back before my trip ends.

La Cantine des Gazelles is a quaint little restaurant just around the corner from the Jemaa el F'na, with a friendly atmosphere with excellent prices. However, I ordered the vegetarian tagine and was very disappointed! It was incredibly plain and merely consisted of cooked vegetables. The vegetables were lovely but there wasn't a hint of sauce so I wouldn't even call it a tagine. I had to add salt and pepper to give a hint more flavour. The meals containing meat were of a much better quality. We tried a few restaurants in the same area and there are much better options for vegetarians in places nearby.

The have a great 85 dirham menu. Unfortunately I really wanted the beef tagine and this is not included on that menu. I had the pastilla for starter which is so generous and filling it could easily be shared between two people. My tagine was wonderful with the beef falling to pieces. Make sure you ask what the specials are. The service is excellent and they speak very good English which was certainly required when a rather fussy group arrived and wanted things cooked a particular way. It can be a little difficult to find so keep to the right in Jemaa el-fna, and when you get to a crossing with the Berber market signposted left and a street sign on the right saying Rue Kennaria turn down this alley and it is a few minutes along on the left hand side.

This was not our favourite restaurant, but it was the best food for complexity and quality. The starter platters were excellent, really very good indeed. You choose either hot or cold and about 8 mini tasters arrive. All are delicious. We have mains of Lamb tagine and fish fillet and again they were very good.  The setting is lovely and unique. The pool, bamboo and creeping flowers giving it an African cheque feel similar to Senegal. It's more of a courtyard than riad and it benefits from it. If going in the evening book to make sure you are outside, but during the day we were able to just turn up.  The waiters english is not so good, this is very much a French resturant, but you'll not have any problems. The staff were freindly, welcoming and as the resutant emptied they let us sit on and read with mint tea as they reset for the evening around us.

Visiting Marrakech is quite daunting when it comes to eating out. There are so many restaurants and tons that claim to be offering good local cuisine. As someone who spends quite a bit of time there I would highly recommend the food at Dar Moha. It is good quality food and the service is excellent. Get a table outside on the terrace by the pool. Many locals eat here also which is always a good sign!

There is almost too much food to try but all dishes were delicious. I then opted for the sea bass tagine which was a delight, and then the sorbet dessert. The wine was also exquisite. The ambience was helped by a sitar player in the far corner of the restaurant, and later followed by a pair of traditional Moroccan musicians. The restaurant is beautiful; the staff attentive and helpful. Would recommend everyone visits Dar Moha when in Marrakech. It's an absolute treat.

It is now owned and run by master and celebrity chef Mohamed Fedal. The property is typical of a property that from the outside looks very ordinary but inside lies a wonderful courtyard with pool. Many of the tables are set around the pool. The courtyard has been decorated in the YSL blue of Majorelle gardens to reflect this was once owned by the designer Balmain a friend of YSL. The meal of an evening is a set course as is many restaurants of this type. But it's good value at 530dh per person. Service good and friendly with all night entertainment around the pool. Go try it.

The restaurant itself is cozy and the seating around the pool was very pretty. We were impressed with the service at first and enjoyed the musical entertainment. The price of the fixed menu shocked us though - 530Dh per person! This was more than double we had paid for any meal yet in Morocco!! We hadn't ate out much though, so we figured it must be worth it. It started off strong with at least 14 Moroccan salads & little appetizers brought to our table which were tasty and different. We ordered the pigeon pastry for our 2nd course, and expected a savoury pastry. It was coated in icing sugar & cinnamon which was unexpected. For our main, we had the lemon chicken and lamb tagines. Again, neither was extraordinary. My lamb was tough and tasteless. We'd had much better of both dishes for a fraction of the price at our riads. In total with wine, our bill was 695Dh each. We were allowed to pay by credit card, but the waiter miscalculated and undercharged our cards without us realizing. I was talking to the head waiter before we left, when the hostess came over and demanded the extra 100Dh. The head waiter took off and neither apologized for what was their mistake. We had also left a generous 150Dh tip for the server. Needless to say, we left with a very bad taste in our mouths. Save your money & don't go. Better food with equally good atmosphere can be had elsewhere I'm sure.

We LOVED the selection of warm starter plates (see photo) - they cost 120 dirhams (under £10) and included cheese, prawn, chicken, minced meat and aubergine tasters - yummy! For our main course we had skewers of fish (200 dh - about £15) and chicken (150dh - about £12). The fish was a touch dry for me, but certainly tasty. All in, with drinks was 600dh - about £45. The staff were super-polite, the service well paced and the selection of nuts and seeds served ahead of our starter was lovely. The setting was perfect - surrounded by high walls and so quiet. A really enjoyable part of our stay in Marrakech and an oasis of calm and more upmarket dining after the hurly-burly of the Medina.

There has been too much brouhaha over different notions of great Indian food over the years, with some people really going OTT with 'molecules' and nitrogen and other absurd combinations. Please, stop! Good Indian food is about wholesome ingredients, perfectly chosen meats and seafood, cultural secrets, and a chef that can take all this and toss it up into something spectacular. The Crossing (TC) has managed to do just this and a lot more! You first enter a very lovely looking restaurant with some minimalism infused with contemporary style and are greeted by extremely friendly staff who really want you to enjoy your evening out. They are also very clued in on all the food, it's origin, what to pair it with, and how that particular story unfolded. Kudos to really explaining everything with zest, passion, and heart! Let's get one thing straight - TC is not out there to be another 'find dining but so-boring' restaurant. They are not cluttering tables with 17 glasses per person and more cutlery than a wedding demands. It's all about simplicity and passion here. As soon as you settle in, the first thing you will probably notice (apart from the brilliant music) are the faces of the other patrons Pure joy is what you will see. This really gives you a lot of confidence about the food. We ordered a LOT of food because everything sounded so good! Gunpowder prawns, butter chicken, saag (which I have NEVER ordered before, ever), dal moradabad (fantastic!), mango seafood curry, keema rice (the simplicity and flavours of this dish were amazing), lamb and chicken grills, and breads. Each dish's level of spice and taste/flavour was a 100% on point. There was a little quirkiness in every dish too, which only added to the brilliance of the experience. Again, nothing even remotely OTT (think in the lines of pairing a Gucci suit with some Air Jordans or Yeezys - brilliant, huh??) Honestly, I had not enjoyed some of the ingredients being paired together in so many ways as I did at TC. Some brilliant research work done on our country's varied gastronomies and many exhaustive hours spent in the kitchen, for sure. Overall, highly recommended to everyone who wants a taste of the India that effortlessly mixes the north with the south and the east with the west and then does it all again! I'll be back soon, with a new bunch of people I can take there to showcase what Indians do best - serve and surprise.

The food was delicious and was a mix of Thai / Chinese cuisine. The Thai green curry in particular was very good and the best we’ve had outside of Thailand.  Our only comment was that this restaurant was not part of the all inclusive package so you only got a contribution towards the cost of the meal. We couldn’t see a reason why this wasn’t included in the package (particularly the drinks, which were expensive, notwithstanding they were the same drinks included for free in the restaurants/bars just next door).  Overall a fantastic experience and well worth a visit, but just be wary of the additional charges.

It felt more like one of those very casual dining places in karama/Deira except obviously we’re paying fine dining prices at 400 are per head (without alcohol). Even with the entertainer voucher it’s poor value for money and I’d advise you to steer clear. Much better value offerings elsewhere.

The menu was quite comprehensive for a pub and served both western as well as middle eastern food and Indian dishes as well.  We ordered Salt and Pepper Prawns and Calamari and as one of the party could not have any oil or fat in their food and asked our waitress if the chef could make a plain rice dish with shredded chicken, she said that this would not be a problem.  She also pointed out that the two dishes we had ordered included a beer or wine, exceptional value as the Prawn dish with a Stella was 45 Dirhams and the Calamari with another pint of Stella was 47 Dirhams ( extremely good value in Dubai)  The food arrived and was fantastic, really tasty and such good value, the the service by our waitress (I’m so sorry I can’t remember your name) a young Indian lady was first rate.

My favorite dishes are the spicy tomato salad, the calamari in garlic sauce, grilled prawns and of course the grilled hamour. You can chose the seafood at a counter where it is displayed on ice. The service is friendly and usually very fast.

Fantastic service weather you are relaxing by the pool or a light lunch in the Shade or late afternoon happy hour, the Plaj accommodates.  We have stayed at the JZS on 13 Previous stays and it was great to see some of the familiar staff here. The Plaj runs like clockwork under the leadership of Adam who look after us so we’ll along with his attentive team. Too many staff to thank but Vincy, May and or course Adam bent over backwards. It was my daughter’s birthday during our stay and Adam and the team brought a cake to our sunbed and sang happy birthday which was a lovely touch.  lunch was great with the warm tomato bread to start and chicken Caesar salad was lovely. I thought enjoyed happy hour with cocktails, wine beer and a Selection of spirits 2 for 1. A lovely touch now is sofas on the beach which was great as the sun went down having a cold beer and some Crisps pre Dinner.  For anyone wishing to eat by the pool One new and welcome addition is the food boxes now used if you Order to eat by the pool which are great in deterring the cheeky Birds who previously flipped the plate Covers off!  Thank you Adam and the team so the most impeccable service as always.

The decor is good, well lighted, the seating is a little cramped for large groups(inside), we were 8 of us and it was a little difficult to move around.  The food is awesome especially the mutton biryani. So tender it melts in your mouth. The mutton cutlet on a roti is also soft like butter, a must try.  All in all, a place to visit every time in DXB.

I arrived there for a dinner with a friend, and there was nobody to welcome us and take us to the table where we have to sit... a busy guy showed up suddenly and gave us the table. The staff members were so busy doing nothing I guess, because there was only 3 other tables with customers. After 10 minutes of searching to whom I should give my order, a gentleman showed up and took the order. I ordered 3 main dishes and 1 nan and 1 rooti... the waiter didn’t give me any advices with the bread amount, as 2 bread is fine for me, but not in Gazebo... the bread size is quarter to the regular size of the bread, yes! Maybe less that the quarter! When I saw the bread, I ordered more and it took forever to arrive. Also, I asked the waiter to bring me corn snacks (papad) and he asked me, how many pieces? It was my first time to be asked how many pieces I need... because they bring it with the starter, and regardless the level of the restaurant, they bring 5-6 pieces... but I ordered 4... and till now it didn’t come... it never came... I told the waiter about it when I was leaving... and he simply forgot... food was good and below the very good, the price is very good to compare it with the food quality.

I really love their grills specifically the mutton kebab. I dont think of all the place where ive had food they serve as good at this  Other things to definitely try is the papdi chaat. Really tasty.  Zaitooni salad is also a must try.  In curries, my top spot goes to the chicken tikka masala.  Their butter chicken is good too for those who cant have spicy food.  In veg, i prefer their aloo gobi adraki, very nice amd savory.  And highly recommended are their yellow dal tadka or the dal makhano. Both are very good.  Their briyani would be the best in town in terms of taste and serving. Either one, You cannot go wrong in briyani at gazebo.  Until next time  Bon Appetit

The food was not up to these standards.	We found Gazebo via Google's listings and it had good reviews. Everyone else inside the restaurant was Indian/Asian. We had very high expectations. The place was beautiful and every detail was looked after in an excellent manner. If you take friends, clients or a date, they will like the ambiance. Parking was a little tough but that's a Dubai issue.  Finally comes the food. It was a mixed bag. The appetizers were above average. The Beryani was pretty good. The rest of the food was average and the Hamour fish was below average. I grew up in Dubai and have had Indian food in many cities around the world. The food here is nothing special. Very unfortunate as it was one of very few restaurants we were able to try during our trip to Dubai and we didn't expect a well appointed restaurant with Indian food in competitive Dubai to have average food.  You can get an idea of pricing from the attached image. The prices, for an American consumer, were very reasonable. Total for 4 people was around $70 (255 AED).

The chicken hyderabadi meat contained the same pieces of meat, it was not the proper chicken breast succulent pieces. I also ended up with an upset stomach the day after. I will not be visiting this place and would recommend you look for an alternative indian restaurant.

This fine restaurant is located on a wide street in Bur Dubai, so parking is really not a problem . I went out for dinner with the family, and found our choice to be good, given the restaurant's excellent decor and ambience . Although Gazebo predominantly serves non vegetarian dishes , it is a vegetarians' delight as well, with prompt and courteous service . A bit expensive , but recommended all the same, for a fine gastronomic experience .

Very clean place, nice ambience, good service, not pretentious, very accommodating very welcoming even for those first timers for Indian cuisine. Food was perfect.

The presentation of the food is very appetizing. The price is surprisingly very modest. We visited Mankool and Bin Sougat. Both are great success.

It is probably the best Indian restaurants around. For the price paid, you get double the value on taste. The food is absolutely delicious and gives you a heavenly experience.

I wholeheartedly give my five star rating to this restaurant chain.

Their dishes are prepared extremely well and taste great. I would definitely try their mutton biryani and Aloo chutneywala (marinated baby potatoes). Their best dish by far, though, is the Raan E Sikandari (leg of lamb). Do not miss out on it.

Also it was packed , we got luck with a table and the service was still very good - the waiter helped with the selection and our dishes were served promptly.  I ordered a Murgh Hyderbadi Biryani for myself . My two friends being vegetarian's ordered a Subzi Masala Biryani. The Food were served in clay pot with a nan covering the top . Great presentation. The food tasted Yum but a bit too spicy - we did ask for mild spicy dishes. One of the first time i enjoyed a Biryani. The quantity's are huge and one dish is enough for at-lest two people.  From what i saw of other tables people were ordering all sorts of dishes and enjoying them. Will like to try out other stuff when i am next time over to.

Visited the Gazebo after hearing about how good their cuisine is & celebrate a B'Day . Was disappointed with what was dished out . The starters were alright , but the rest of the meal was below average . The meat in the Mutton Rogan Josh though soft was BLACK inside and very unappetizing once you dug into it . The Chicken Curries were chunky pieces of frozen Chicken . And the so called DUM Biryani, is a sham as its curry mixed with rice (of average quality) and served in an earthen pot with a Tandoori Roti that balloons up to make it look Good , but is not authentic Dum Pukht Biryani. And the meal quite Expensive mind you for what they dish out . Would not go back.

We made a reservation on google, and it was honored. Suggest making a reservation in advance, as it seems pretty popular. Just FYI the restaurant looks like it is in a residential area, depending on where you come from. But it is with a cluster of some other restaurants. Indoor/outdoor dining options.  The pasta is homemade and super fresh, almost as good as when we were in Italy. Great wine/drink list, and reasonable prices for what you get. Good selection of appetizers, and had very friendly service. They offer complimentary limoncello after dinner. The bathrooms were also very clean.  We ended up also having this as our last dinner, since it was so good. Lots of options for both meat eaters, and vegetarians. The appetizers are a very good size, and so were the pasta portions.  My husband had the linguine with prawns the first night, and said it was one of the best he has had. He also said the same about the Amatriciana (wasn't super spicy). I got the ragù the first night, which was excellent, and the macaroni with the asparagus & pancetta the 2nd night, which was super light and full of flavor.

This week is all about Truffles from Alba (Dinner exclusive!!!) so you can enjoy the Tortellinis and Scallopinis, subtly bathed in one of Italy's finest (and let us say tastiest) exports.  As mentioned, the owners are nice and will make you feel so comfortable you just can't stop talking (and drinking and ordering more food!).  One might find it pricey but I didn't think so - as also mentioned it is, in my humble opinion, the best Italian choice in the Portuguese capital.

I was very lucky to get a table on the first night as I hadn't booked until about 3pm for an 8 pm meal. I was very lucky and I say many people waiting for tables.  Food was fabulous, my wife is a vegetarian and she had plenty of choice too. We had 3 courses including drinks and paid around 60 Euro which for the quality of the food and service was more than reasonable in my opinion.  The staff were very good and if i was to give them any developmental feedback it would be to take a little more time with the diners as I did feel a little rushed on the second night. I appreciate they want to turn tables but they should be leaving gaps of at least 15 to 20 mins between courses. Overall, I have to give them a 5 star rating as the quality of the food and service overall deserved 5 stars.  Go there!

We made a reservation online, which was really practical. When we arrived, the place was pretty packed, so I would say that the reservation is quite needed. We were seated in the first floor of the restaurant. The place is really nice and romantic (dimmed lights, dark wood) and I would say it is a perfect place for a romantic dinner. We ordered a margherita buffala pizza and pizza capriciossa. Both were really tasty. We love pizza napoletana and we eat it quite often when we are at home (we live next to the border with Italy) and these pizzas really were everything you would expect from a napoletan pizza. For dessert we had a cheesecake, which was really light, but tasted more like a whipped creme than cream cheese. It was still pretty good. After the meal, the waiter offered as some port wine, which was a really nice gesture. If you are looking for some good italian food in Lisbon, I would recommend this place.

We would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant if you like authentic Nepalese fayre.

They both work as an excellent team so welcoming and friendly and more than happy to have a chat when they are not seeing to their other customers, it is a pleasure to be in their company. I suppose I should talk about the food, it is simply superb and a pleasure to eat what more do you need to know, it was that good that we booked another night with them.

We decided to have a stroll around some of Lisbons many bars and eateries and graze on some of the fantastic food. ( well that was the plan ) We both liked the look of Grau Douro from the reviews and found the establishment very easily in Rua Dunques de Braganca. On arrival the small (but cosy) place was very busy and having no booking we were offered a seat at the bar.This offer was accepted and the owner came straight over with the drinks menu , we are not knowledgeable about Portuguese wine so asked for some guidance. He asked what we liked and suggested a couple of wines ( neither were expensive) and promptly poured a taste of each, followed by a full measure. We quaffed the lovely wine ordered some more and asked for the food menu. The owner who was clearly in control of the whole show was exhilarating to watch , moving from table to table , laughing and joking with the customers and even playing the accordion from time to time a delight to observe. The food arrived Covert ( bread with oil ) the Prawns in garlic sauce and a portion of Bacalhau a bras (codfish , slices of potato and egg cooked in the oven) both dishes were absolutely delicious. Unfortunately by siting at the bar the Toucinho do Ceo do Avo ( Grandpa`s Heavenly Tart ) was positioned on the bar top just in front of us , so a portion along with a very nice glass of port had to be consumed to finish the night. Everything about the place is fantastic, the food is amazing , the staff are friendly and great , the atmosphere is homely , all in all a great find , needless to say we only managed the one bar that night best laid plans and all that. Grau Douro thankyou for a Fantastic Evening. We will be back.

Off the beaten path so wouldn’t have just walked past so very happy we researched where to eat. You can’t book so we were lucky to be squeezed in on the last table. Slightly disappointed we didn’t arrive hungrier after having a big lunch as what we did have was so delicious we would have liked to taste more. We had prawns, chorizo and chicken wings. Prawns and chorizo were delicious - would pass on the wings. Shared an almond torte for dessert which was amazing. Small and good vibe bar and restaurant. Lovely bottle of wine, great atmosphere, very attentive friendly service from the owner and good tunes. If we come back to Lisbon we would definitely go back and we highly recommend.

Would defo revisit and recommend but arrive early as they don’t take bookings.

Book early as they are always full!	We LOVED this restaurant and went twice. Nice outdoor dining area with heaters, but the inside is best. Anabela and Joana were wonderful wait staff although I believe Joana was the manager. The food will blow you away. I have a grilled octopus salad that was addictive as was the cheesecake parfait which I split with my husband only to order another for myself. I have celiac and must eat gluten free and they took precautions that I very much appreciated. Book early as they are always full.

The food is fantastic and Wiki our server was awesome. Get the Octopus if you like that sort of thing, it really was the best I have had and I love octopus! My husbands fish was excellent as well. Just a great dining experience.

We shared the shrimp appetizer. The sauce was sublime - deep and rich with layers of flavor and just the right amount of heat from the chilis. And the bread to soak up the sauce was fresh and crusty. The wine they suggested was excellent. I also had the sea bream, which was grilled perfectly. The vegetables were simple but delicous - sauteed with olive oil and sea salt. A perfect complement. A scoop of ice cream for dessert was a simple palate cleanser. My wife had the melted sheep cheese and it was a little strong. She had the seafood stew and it was a nice, subtle bisque.

One thing mentioned in the reviews was that this place has Lisbon's best octopus dish. It didn't disappoint. We had outdoor seating and it was fabulous to feel the pulse of the city while enjoying great food.  Our server (his name is Wiki) was super friendly and super attentive. He asked us where we are from, currently and originally, and said 谢谢 to us many times after that point.

( my husband had a restaurant in Yountville Ca and worked in the industry for over 30 years so when he says something is good you can trust it) I had the vegetarian soup to start and sea bass with prawn and green curry.

Service was spot on too , thank you Luz. Menu are QR code or ask for a paper one if you do not have your phone.  Shared a starter of the tuna ceviche which was lovely and fresh, cubes of mango and cucumber with a nice citrus dressing and salad leaves , the croquettes were better than I expected and very tasty.  The duck came on sweet potato puree with zucchini strips and some crisps - quite delicious. The pork was a sight , a big haunch of meat served with a bowl of fries, it tasted amazing and the meat was cooked perfectly.  Shared a rather good lemon meringue pie for dessert which was yummy. House wine was not too expensive at €16 a bottle, total came to €76.50 including water at €1.50  Service was excellent considering how busy they were serving both the inside and outside tables, keep up the good work !

Word is out that they have good food.  My partner and I shared a prawn appetizer. Do Europeans think it's fun for customers to dismember whole prawns, eyeballs and all? It's not! I don't like having to work so hard to get to the edible bits in a restaurant. The prawn flesh was tasty and the lemony garlicky sauce was good enough to eat with a spoon (which I did).  We both ordered the grilled octopus that came with a few thin spears of broccolini and three small whole potatoes. The octopus was perfect. Tender and succulent, with delicious shavings of crispy garlic in the sauce.  We asked for tap water and were given filtered water and charged 1.50 euro. Not a lot but tap water is very drinkable in Lisbon and they should make it available for free.  To compliment the meal we each had a glass of tasty wine, not overpriced at 5 euro a glass.

Only one thing we didn't like is that they charged us for the water being also from the tap.
