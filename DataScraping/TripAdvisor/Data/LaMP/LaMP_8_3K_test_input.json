A bread plate is served which looks just like cut sliced bread but is in fact quite nice and we had a second helping.  The spring rolls were good and the accompanying sauce is not overly sweet as is often the case, but not here.  The t-bone was very nice. A bit of char and smoky flavour. It was ordered medium-rare and came slightly over but it was still heartily enjoyed.  The tenderloin was a much thicker cut and also ordered medium-rare. It came slightly under.  The presentation of the steaks and the condiments is excellent.  The margaritas were very good and generous with the tequila.  Coffees and more banter with the staff finished a very enjoyable night and our best meal in Siem Reap over three days.  The food for the price plus the service makes this place a winner.

We were greeted and seated in a most professional way, and the staff were lovely and friendly as always. Now for the best part - THE FOOD! I had the raw fish salad for my entr\u00e9e and it was so unbelievably delicious that we went back numerous times and I always ordered the same entr\u00e9e. My husband fell in love with the prawn Caesar salad, which is huge for an entr\u00e9e. We tried something different every time for a main and everything we tried was just beautiful. The service staff are very attentive and the prices are very reasonable. All money goes towards their training program, which has a 100% success rate of placing graduates. Located only a couple of minutes out of town by tuk tuk ($6 for a return trip is heaps), it is well worth it. The restaurant area is located in the upstairs part of the building and it is lovely and cool. I can not praise Sala Bai, it's food and it's staff enough. Do yourself a favour and visit.

We made a reservation on google, and it was honored. Suggest making a reservation in advance, as it seems pretty popular. Just FYI the restaurant looks like it is in a residential area, depending on where you come from. But it is with a cluster of some other restaurants. Indoor/outdoor dining options.  The pasta is homemade and super fresh, almost as good as when we were in Italy. Great wine/drink list, and reasonable prices for what you get. Good selection of appetizers, and had very friendly service. They offer complimentary limoncello after dinner. The bathrooms were also very clean.  We ended up also having this as our last dinner, since it was so good. Lots of options for both meat eaters, and vegetarians. The appetizers are a very good size, and so were the pasta portions.  My husband had the linguine with prawns the first night, and said it was one of the best he has had. He also said the same about the Amatriciana (wasn't super spicy). I got the rag\u00f9 the first night, which was excellent, and the macaroni with the asparagus & pancetta the 2nd night, which was super light and full of flavor."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngaS422", "user_id": "Jamie S", "user_name": "Jamie S", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Utrecht, The", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 40.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 37.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": [{"id": "72630", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g482942-d2056888-Reviews-Salt_Pepper-Fira_Santorini_Cyclades_South_Aegean.html", "review_date": "October 17, 2018", "review_city": "Santorini, Greece", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Husband and Wife team serving delicious, flavorful meals", "review": "3 words - MAKE A RESERVATION. It was off-peak season when my husband and I went and we got a reservation through our hotel. Boy am I glad we did because we saw about 10 couples get turned down for not having one. Almost every table was marked \"reserved\" when we arrived at opening.  There is a good reason for the reservations because the food is so delicious, so flavorful, and home cooked right behind the counter by the husband of the husband/wife team. The wife serves the food and takes the orders and she is SO friendly (unless you dont have a reservation).  They have a good wine selection and the menu is significantly large. I was feeling a little under the weather when we got there so I got a soup - oh my gosh - it was just a simple mushroom soup but we soaked up every last drop with the bread and she came over and hugged us because she saw me soaking up the last bit of liquid and laughed at us. But it was that good. We also got the tomato balls, a must for being in Greece, and they were served with tzatziki, SO GOOD. My husband complimented that for a fried food it was so light. We also got the beer chicken and a seabass - both were amazing, we finished basically everything. They also give a complimentary dessert (assuming they rotate). Ours was some phyllo dough with some cream maybe (not really sure) but so good. The wife also takes a picture of every table and puts it on her facebook site, which I think is pretty cool.  We wanted to go back a second time in our 3 dinners we had in Santorini, but then figured we should try something else....regreted not going back.

The restaurant itself is cozy and the seating around the pool was very pretty. We were impressed with the service at first and enjoyed the musical entertainment. The price of the fixed menu shocked us though - 530Dh per person! This was more than double we had paid for any meal yet in Morocco!! We hadn't ate out much though, so we figured it must be worth it. It started off strong with at least 14 Moroccan salads & little appetizers brought to our table which were tasty and different. We ordered the pigeon pastry for our 2nd course, and expected a savoury pastry. It was coated in icing sugar & cinnamon which was unexpected. For our main, we had the lemon chicken and lamb tagines. Again, neither was extraordinary. My lamb was tough and tasteless. We'd had much better of both dishes for a fraction of the price at our riads. In total with wine, our bill was 695Dh each. We were allowed to pay by credit card, but the waiter miscalculated and undercharged our cards without us realizing. I was talking to the head waiter before we left, when the hostess came over and demanded the extra 100Dh. The head waiter took off and neither apologized for what was their mistake. We had also left a generous 150Dh tip for the server. Needless to say, we left with a very bad taste in our mouths. Save your money & don't go. Better food with equally good atmosphere can be had elsewhere I'm sure."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngaS422", "user_id": "Jamie S", "user_name": "Jamie S", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Utrecht, The", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 40.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 37.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "7278", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d719675-Reviews-Launceston_Place-London_England.html", "review_date": "June 29, 2019", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Fabulous evening", "review": "Came here when in London last weekend and stopping around the corner.

We first went because we were a little tired after arriving and it was easy. The 7 course Khmer tasting menu changes every night so no chance of getting bored with the food. There is an \"normal\" menu as well if you don't feel adventurous.  We had the tasting menu and enjoyed it very much. At $31 per head, it is great value. Wine is available at various price levels.We though the courses came out a little fast, but that is often the case in Asia, The size of the tasting plates was just right. I would comment that the wine was not quite chilled enough, but some time in the bucket solved that. Not a big problem.

We are fortunate to have eaten some excellent meals on five continents but this restaurant served us one of top five meals of all time.  The restaurant is staffed throughout by females and, without wishing to sound sexist, I truly believe you can taste and experience their delicate and feminine touch throughout.  My wife and I were privileged to enjoy their seven course, regularly changing, tasting menu and were rewarded with some exceptional, exquisite tastes. Presentation and service were exemplary too.  Combined with a four glass classic wine pairing for me and a four cup tea tasting for my wife, the cost isn't cheap in Siem Reap terms but at $36 per person for food, $29 for four glass of paired wine or $15 for four deliciously flavoured teas, it's incredible value for money given the quality of food, presentation and service on offer.  In addition we were given complementary amuse bouche to start, had opportunity to thank one of the chefs direct and were given a leaving gift of their exquisitely presented, complementary macaroons.  An exceptional experience that I would repeat in a heartbeat, I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly.

We where unsure where to try a 'high end' meal in Hanoi, after being given several inconsistent recommendations by previous visitors or tour guides.  For us, Cloud Nine fitted the bill perfectly and we enjoyed our first visit so much that we chose to return again on our final night in Asia.  Located in the La Siesta H\u00e0ng be Hotel, just below the rooftop bar (both reviewed elsewhere) its central to the Old Quarter but has far reaching views in all directions across the city. The decor is undoubtedly chic, with a hint of French presented with a wonderful Asian style and finesse.  They served a mix of Vietnamese and western food, although we only ate from the Vietnamese menu.  They offer a tasting menu at \u00a317 per head but each night we chose to dine a la carte and spent a little more (approx. \u00a325 excluding drinks) but the food, quality, preparation and presentation was absolutely first class.  What sets this restaurant apart though is the quality of service. Anyone who has traveled in SE Asia will know that, if you pay a little more, the quality of service is consistently good. Here it was truly exceptional.  From the very first moment, restaurant supervisor/ maitre d', Amber, ensures that you're welcomed, relaxed and served to your satisfaction. Not that she should have any concerns, as the staff are all, without exception, attentive and polite.  On both occasions we ate here, our server was Huyen. An absolute delight to deal with, her English was seriously impressive, indeed we found her easier to understand than some of our more heavily accented tour guides! She really exceeded any reasonable expectations of service.  On our return visit we were both treated like long lost friends and we'll take memories such as that away with us.  For the record, over our two visits, we ate the special chef spring rolls, Hanoi deep fried spring rolls, Phu Bo, asparagus and crab meat soup, Tom Yum Kung soup, green mango seafood salad, beef on hot stones and Tiger prawns in coconut. We never made it to dessert! In addition, they serve a complimentary amuse bouche to start and a refreshing drink to close.  A truly wonderful experience and I would highly recommend."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 5.0}}]}}, {"id": "7294", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d7814915-Reviews-Loi_Estiatorio-New_York_City_New_York.html", "review_date": "April 2, 2018", "review_city": "New York City, United States", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Best Dinner in NYC", "review": "This place is terrific!

Because of the comfortable atmosphere created by the staff/owners, it makes the burgers all the better. My two kids had the chicken skewers which were so tender and full of flavor. The burgers melted in your mouth. Quite honestly, the general consensus was that the burgers were slightly bland for our collective tastes (my father asked them to spice up his burger and that was \"solved\" by sprinkling some spice as opposed to putting it in the meat), but one cannot question the quality of cooking and ingredients.

So I was delighted when a friend suggested that a group of us should go to Chamisse this week. It is a very good restaurant, most of the team are Lebanese and the welcome is warm.  The setting is very simple, which is fine: the focus is always on the food. We chose to have a selection of mezzo and a selection of grills placed down the table so that the group of 20 could chat and eat contentedly without making choices. This is where Lebanese food it as its best, being shared by everybody with a little bit of this and more of that up and down the table. Small dishes flowed in (kebbeh, kellaj, fatayr, hummus, mfassack, tabbouleh, fattoush, loubieh bel zeit, labneh, moutabbel and more besides) and all tasted very good. My only comment was that some of the flavours were slightly blander than I like but they were very good. In particular the kebbeh was as good as I have tasted (deliciously moist in the middle and crunchy on the outside) and the labneh was wonderfully subtle. So definitely 4 plus for the food.

The champignons de bois had an excellent taste, an amazing texture. The salad topping was not mine, but all in a bite very good. The main course was an Argentine Entrecote, cooked to perfection. All these dishes are presented in a good manner at a nice location. The ambiance is great, following the theme of this restaurant. The host and the staff in general: keen, nice, helpful and attentive. Nothing to complain about and to be honest: we ate worse at Michelin Star restaurants.

The \"puerta cerrada\" (or \"closed door\") movement is new to us, but we'll be searching it out more often. What sets Casa Salt Shaker apart (aside from the food and drink, but more on that later) is the communal table. While many closed door restaurants have gone to traditional restaurant style seating, Casa Salt Shaker has maintained their communal table which made for a delightful evening. We sat with 8 other English speaking guests from the US (living in Chile, and living in Alaska), UK and New Zealand. What a diverse and well traveled and engaging group!  Now - the food! Dan is a master in the kitchen! Three of us were pescatarians, so Dan made an entire pescatarian-friendly meal. The meat eaters among us were thrilled to take a break from their Argentine meat frenzy. We savored homemade bread, Peruvian ceviche, Timbuche (the most delicious cilantro/albacore soup I've ever had!), corn ravioli, pollack with chimichurri hollandaise, and pineapple cheesecake, along with perfectly paired wines. Along with being an extraordinary cook, Dan is also a wonderful conversationalist and we learned a lot about life as an expat in Argentina. Dan doesn't speak much English but is delightful with his shy smile and quiet demeanor. The $80 (US) that we spent each was an incredible value given the quality (and quantity) of the food and wine, No tiny tastes or mere splashes of wine here."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngaS422", "user_id": "Jamie S", "user_name": "Jamie S", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Utrecht, The", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 40.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 37.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "72153", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d1520116-Reviews-Floresta_Das_Escadinhas-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html", "review_date": "December 1, 2022", "review_city": "Lisbon, Portugal", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Nice and cozy seafood restaurant.", "review": "Great seafood restaurant, small but cozy, the staffs are nice and friendly.

We also ordered a side salad, that was merely fresh lettuce with a light vinegar and oil dressing, and French fries cooked in duck fat. For dessert, our waiter offered us a dessert not on the menu, which turned out to be very thinly sliced fresh pineapple with a dulce leche (caramel) sauce drizzled on it and little toffee crumbles.

I thought enjoyed happy hour with cocktails, wine beer and a Selection of spirits 2 for 1. A lovely touch now is sofas on the beach which was great as the sun went down having a cold beer and some Crisps pre Dinner.

We were quite surprised that after such a long time the restaurant was still making memories for locals and tourists alike.  This is not a restaurant that you decide to drop in on at the last minute. It's often booked out well in advance and sports around 7 or so tables for a very intimate dining experience with friends or loved ones. In fact, we booked over a month in advance to make sure they could seat our party of 5.  Plan to take your time and this is one location that it pays to trust the kitchen, as they have a fantastic degustation menu, featuring ingredients from the South Island of New Zealand. Matching New Zealand wines are also on offer and in my opinion you're missing a fabulous experience if you choose to \u00e0 la carte.  We started the evening with cocktails followed by a dish titled \"Amuse\" - described as a daily creation or local delicacy. On this day, we were served a starter of Cervena Venison. It came cooked perfectly with 3 beautiful contrasting sauces.  The next dish was a choice from the Southern Ocean or Marlborough region, scallops or wild boar respectively. I chose the boar - Mille Peuille of apple, parsnip remoulade with a well matched Amisfield Pinot Gris from Central Otago.  The next course hailed from the West Coast or Bannockburn - Conit of baby abalone, or Seared Loin of hare and braised leg. The hare was served with confit kumura (New Zealand native sweet potato), sour cherries, kawakawa jus and a Surveyor Thompson Pinot Noir from Central Otago.  A nice little citrus sorbet followed as a palate cleanser.  The Main course was either a Centrol Otago Alpine Merino lamb backstrap and braised neck, or Nelson sourced seared pink snapper. The Merino Lamb was spectacular, served with baby vegetables, pea sponge, thyme jus and a Church Road Reserve Merlot/Cabernet blend from the Hawkes Bay.  Dessert was a classic New Zealand kiwi fruit pavola with local fruit and mascarpone with a Brancott Letter Series Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough.  Lastly, we were treated to a local cheese selection with figs, nuts and a Cloudy Bay Late Harvest Riesling from Marlborough once again.  The wait staff were fantastic. Every course was described in detail and the quality of service was second to none.  Treat yourself to an experience and make sure The Bunker is on your list when you next visit Queenstown.  Highly Recommended."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngaS422", "user_id": "Jamie S", "user_name": "Jamie S", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Utrecht, The", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 40.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 37.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "72221", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d8178635-Reviews-Damnak_Lounge_Fine_Dining-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "May 20, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Cambodian food with a French flair", "review": "When we checked in, we were told there were two fine dining restaurants on property: one that served mostly western style food, and one that served Cambodian food.

The Khmer Savory Menu looked like a great deal \u2013 55 USD with wine parings.  First a tempura oyster with three sauces. Small, but it was supposed to be just a taste.  Next came two kinds of fish cakes, with three garnishes: one a pickled papaya and onion; a raw green papaya salad; and purple cabbage. Everything was arranged on top of three spicy sauces and diced tomatoes.  This was followed by a chicken soup served over a mix of steamed and fresh vegetables.  We were served a mango intermezzo; and then the entrees. I selected the wok stir fried beef and vegetables, and my wife ordered the river bar fish. We traded off and agreed they were both excellent.  The meal was accompanied by fresh baked baguettes and two kinds of flavored butter.  We finished with a warm tapioca pudding, with diced bananas and a spoon of coconut ice cream.  At the end of the evening we decided it had far exceeded our expectations for food quality, presentation, and value. The overall amount of food was fine, and all the wine parings were appropriate.

Outside dining with blue and white tones, over looking the ocean (if you are there before sunset). Their online reservation system is VERY broken. We had a reservation for New Year\u2019s Eve (we received an email confirmation) but when we showed up, they had no record of it. They informed us that they were not doing the menu that night and sent us on our way - where are you supposed to find another restaurant at 9 pm on New Year\u2019s Eve? We decided to try again on January 2nd. Again made reservations online...and received an email confirmation. Got to the restaurant and they had no record of the reservation...at least this time they accommodated us. As I said before, a lovely setting. Our waiter had some struggles providing us with accurate menu information (actually was inaccurate on his description of several menu items) and overall the service was fair at best. If you are looking at their menu online - DON\u2019T! It is not the same....and the menu at the restaurant was not descriptive - hard to know what you were going to get. We saw nothing served on a salt block. I am wondering if they have changed management or the menu compared to previous reviews - usually Trip Advisor is a good reflection of a restaurant- but not this time - look only at recent pictures and reviews! Most items were very overpriced! We had Tiger Prawn Cocktail - it was only 2 (two!) prawns and cost 750 Bhat! They were good, but really? We ordered two bottles of wine that were listed in the menu for 1700 bhat and we were charged 2000 bhat per bottle! As for main dishes- the ribeye was fair at best, the scallops were 4 scallops - very tender but otherwise very average...the best dish we had was the blue swimmer crab - 4 crabs, very tasty but a lot of work to eat. The Parmesan mashed potatoes were good, enough for two people. The Lobster Mac and Cheese? Not an accurate description at all...it was more of a pasta in a lobster bisque - no cheese to speak of. We ordered asparagus - sorry, they were out. So, I don\u2019t usually tell people to avoid a restaurant - but we had much better meals and experiences in Phuket- eat elsewhere!"}}, "output": {"review_rating": 2.0}}]}}, {"id": "72228", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d21302648-Reviews-Hibox-London_England.html", "review_date": "October 15, 2020", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "The best Vegan and Palestinian food in town", "review": "Amazing food, this shop has the best taste food ever for Vegans and people like me that enjoys Mezze food.

Professional, prompt to reply, working with us on the 6-course menu (we don't eat meat), adjusting it to our food preferences and the special touches for the celebration.  Then came the evening. Professional welcome, with elegance and grace. Once we got seated, we met James the sommelier. Unbelievably knowledgeable about wines and the profession at large. A delicious glass of champagne to start the evening, followed by an even more divine French red - to die for. On top of it, because we had fish, he recommended - and brought (on the house) - two glasses of white that fit the dish perfectly.  The service from the whole team was superb. SUPERB! Luc was equally professional and friendly, and we engaged in a few conversations about how they run the place, and the world of Michelin stars.  Then came dessert. Or, more specifically, first came the pre-dessert dish. It was followed by two separate dessert dishes, wrapping everything with a chocolate creation of one of the chefs who specializes in chocolate.  We have both \"been around\" and traveled various parts of the world, separate and together - and experienced a variety of restaurants. We unanimously agreed that this was THE BEST restaurant experience of our lives! Sure, it was also the most expensive one - and I would pay it again for this experience, without thinking twice.  Thank you Team Pur' for making this evening so unique for us!"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngaS422", "user_id": "Jamie S", "user_name": "Jamie S", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Utrecht, The", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 40.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 37.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "72241", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293924-d17482834-Reviews-Cloud_Nine_Restaurant-Hanoi.html", "review_date": "February 18, 2020", "review_city": "Hanoi, Vietnam", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Five stars just isn't enough.", "review": "My wife and I had been traveling SE Asia for a month and enjoyed everything from Street food to Michelin star quality.  We where unsure where to try a 'high end' meal in Hanoi, after being given several inconsistent recommendations by previous visitors or tour guides.  For us, Cloud Nine fitted the bill perfectly and we enjoyed our first visit so much that we chose to return again on our final night in Asia.  Located in the La Siesta H\u00e0ng be Hotel, just below the rooftop bar (both reviewed elsewhere) its central to the Old Quarter but has far reaching views in all directions across the city. The decor is undoubtedly chic, with a hint of French presented with a wonderful Asian style and finesse.  They served a mix of Vietnamese and western food, although we only ate from the Vietnamese menu.  They offer a tasting menu at \u00a317 per head but each night we chose to dine a la carte and spent a little more (approx. \u00a325 excluding drinks) but the food, quality, preparation and presentation was absolutely first class.  What sets this restaurant apart though is the quality of service. Anyone who has traveled in SE Asia will know that, if you pay a little more, the quality of service is consistently good. Here it was truly exceptional.  From the very first moment, restaurant supervisor/ maitre d', Amber, ensures that you're welcomed, relaxed and served to your satisfaction. Not that she should have any concerns, as the staff are all, without exception, attentive and polite.  On both occasions we ate here, our server was Huyen. An absolute delight to deal with, her English was seriously impressive, indeed we found her easier to understand than some of our more heavily accented tour guides! She really exceeded any reasonable expectations of service.  On our return visit we were both treated like long lost friends and we'll take memories such as that away with us.  For the record, over our two visits, we ate the special chef spring rolls, Hanoi deep fried spring rolls, Phu Bo, asparagus and crab meat soup, Tom Yum Kung soup, green mango seafood salad, beef on hot stones and Tiger prawns in coconut. We never made it to dessert! In addition, they serve a complimentary amuse bouche to start and a refreshing drink to close.  A truly wonderful experience and I would highly recommend."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngaS422", "user_id": "Jamie S", "user_name": "Jamie S", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Utrecht, The", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 40.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 37.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": [{"id": "722410", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d7260612-Reviews-Embassy_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "February 29, 2020", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Exquisite, unmissable dining experience", "review": "Experiencing the tasting menu at this restaurant is my highest recommendation and top tip following a month long visit to SE Asia.  We are fortunate to have eaten some excellent meals on five continents but this restaurant served us one of top five meals of all time.  The restaurant is staffed throughout by females and, without wishing to sound sexist, I truly believe you can taste and experience their delicate and feminine touch throughout.  My wife and I were privileged to enjoy their seven course, regularly changing, tasting menu and were rewarded with some exceptional, exquisite tastes. Presentation and service were exemplary too.  Combined with a four glass classic wine pairing for me and a four cup tea tasting for my wife, the cost isn't cheap in Siem Reap terms but at $36 per person for food, $29 for four glass of paired wine or $15 for four deliciously flavoured teas, it's incredible value for money given the quality of food, presentation and service on offer.  In addition we were given complementary amuse bouche to start, had opportunity to thank one of the chefs direct and were given a leaving gift of their exquisitely presented, complementary macaroons.  An exceptional experience that I would repeat in a heartbeat, I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly.

In veg, i prefer their aloo gobi adraki, very nice amd savory.  And highly recommended are their yellow dal tadka or the dal makhano. Both are very good.

The staff were all extremely helpful and well trained (better than most service we have elsewhere!). Prices are reasonable. Location is tucked away in quiet street a ten minute walk from the Made in Cambodia market. The garden and indoor seating areas were both charming.
