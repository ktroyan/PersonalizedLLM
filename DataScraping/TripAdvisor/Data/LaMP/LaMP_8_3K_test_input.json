The grilled octopus was tender and delicious and who knew that their tomatoes in the village salad would be so fresh and tasty! All of their spreads were so yummy and also loved their grilled halloumi. Wine selections were excellent and all paired wonderfully with our meal. They accommodated us by doing more 'family-style' with the main courses so we all shared and sampled. The branzino was delicate and light, lamb shank with orzo was tender and rich, and the eggplant was so delicious, it tasted like high-end shepherd's pie! We all had a sampling of their desserts with a flour less chocolate cake which was surprisingly delicate and chocolatey at the same time; a walnut cake that was so moist with honey and I can honestly say that the baklava was the best I've had!"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/lorenyi", "user_id": "lorenyi", "user_name": "lorenyi", "user_ta_level": 4.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Gaithersburg, Maryland", "user_nb_contributions": 34.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 16.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 17.0, "user_nb_photos": 11.0, "user_tags": "Urban Explorer;Peace and Quiet Seeker;Beach Goer;Family Vacationer"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "722", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293734-d2103638-Reviews-Pepe_Nero-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html", "review_date": "April 5, 2019", "review_city": "Marrakech, Morocco", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Almost perfect", "review": "My wife and I visited having read about it in the your book and on TripAdvisor.

My wife went for the Italian options whilst I went for the Moroccan. Both of us enjoyed our food immensely. The salads were delightful and each stood out as a well prepared/cooked dish. My beef tagine easily being the best I've experienced during my visit, with the meat falling away at a touch. My wife with her Italian dishes assured me the aubergine parmigiana was the best she's had, out of several trips to Italy and excellent restaurants. The pasta dish she had was also great.  Where I feel this missed out was that dessert was not great, but just ok. The dishes were decorated with chocolate and raspberry coulis, which tasted more like sauce for ice-cream. Finally, the service once we had finished seemed to disappear, as it took us quite a long time to get their attention to get the bill. By the time we did, we had both gone off the idea of getting a coffee to end the meal with.

We only found it by googling \u201cbest dinner in UBUD\u201d  We tried so, so many places in Ubud, including Twist, Elys Kitchen, and many more \u2014 all amazing, by the way. However, we went to AKAR & our minds were blown. A notch above everywhere we\u2019ve been at home and in Bali.  The atmosphere is unbeatable. The service is surreal, even for bali standards (already a high standard). The food - phenomenal.  The dark chocolate souffl\u00e9 is out of this world, as is the warm brownies.  Ps: no, this is not \u201ccheap & cheerful\u201d, but it\u2019s also not too far at the \u201cfine dining\u201d end of the spectrum either\u2026. portions are good sized. It is truly a must.  Cocktails also unreal.  If you come to UBUD and don\u2019t try this place, you\u2019ve missed out (and Twist)  Finally - no, I\u2019m not on commission ha ha.

We where unsure where to try a 'high end' meal in Hanoi, after being given several inconsistent recommendations by previous visitors or tour guides.  For us, Cloud Nine fitted the bill perfectly and we enjoyed our first visit so much that we chose to return again on our final night in Asia.  Located in the La Siesta H\u00e0ng be Hotel, just below the rooftop bar (both reviewed elsewhere) its central to the Old Quarter but has far reaching views in all directions across the city. The decor is undoubtedly chic, with a hint of French presented with a wonderful Asian style and finesse.  They served a mix of Vietnamese and western food, although we only ate from the Vietnamese menu.  They offer a tasting menu at \u00a317 per head but each night we chose to dine a la carte and spent a little more (approx. \u00a325 excluding drinks) but the food, quality, preparation and presentation was absolutely first class.  What sets this restaurant apart though is the quality of service. Anyone who has traveled in SE Asia will know that, if you pay a little more, the quality of service is consistently good. Here it was truly exceptional.  From the very first moment, restaurant supervisor/ maitre d', Amber, ensures that you're welcomed, relaxed and served to your satisfaction. Not that she should have any concerns, as the staff are all, without exception, attentive and polite.  On both occasions we ate here, our server was Huyen. An absolute delight to deal with, her English was seriously impressive, indeed we found her easier to understand than some of our more heavily accented tour guides! She really exceeded any reasonable expectations of service.  On our return visit we were both treated like long lost friends and we'll take memories such as that away with us.  For the record, over our two visits, we ate the special chef spring rolls, Hanoi deep fried spring rolls, Phu Bo, asparagus and crab meat soup, Tom Yum Kung soup, green mango seafood salad, beef on hot stones and Tiger prawns in coconut. We never made it to dessert! In addition, they serve a complimentary amuse bouche to start and a refreshing drink to close.

Combined with a four glass classic wine pairing for me and a four cup tea tasting for my wife, the cost isn't cheap in Siem Reap terms but at $36 per person for food, $29 for four glass of paired wine or $15 for four deliciously flavoured teas, it's incredible value for money given the quality of food, presentation and service on offer.  In addition we were given complementary amuse bouche to start, had opportunity to thank one of the chefs direct and were given a leaving gift of their exquisitely presented, complementary macaroons.  An exceptional experience that I would repeat in a heartbeat, I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly.

Tables are situated around a pool and a central marble courtyard with a mosaic clad fountain. A large speaker provides some cool background beats. The restaurant offers two menus \u2013 Moroccan and Italian \u2013 with the ability to mix and match both. The latter offered a welcome break from the traditional tagines. The king prawns with diced tomatoes and cocktail sauce and the eggplant mozzarella for starters were both beautifully seasoned and bursting with flavour and the home made fettucine and tortellini parmesan cream for main brought back fond memories of some of the best Italian pasta houses. There is an extensive wine list although the Moroccan wine is slightly on the expensive side. The only downside was the service which can best be described as unfriendly and unengaging and we felt a little rushed with courses arriving quickly when we had indicated we would like a break or, in the case of the bill, unprompted. It was slightly odd to be taken to a back room to pay the bill by credit card but I had nothing to fear in that all of the staff were extremely courteous and polite. This was our stand out favourite restaurant during our nine night stay in Marrakesh and we cannot wait to return.  Tip: Ignore the young men waiting to greet you when you leave the restaurant who will seek to persuade you to follow them on a different route back to the main square on the basis that the conventional route is closed at night. This is a standard ruse at this (and many other) locations and an attempt to fleece you of your hard earned dirhams\u2026\u2026"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rob007Kent_UK", "user_id": "Rob007Kent_UK", "user_name": "Rob007Kent_UK", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Wye, United", "user_nb_contributions": 516.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 168.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 731.0, "user_nb_photos": 37.0, "user_tags": "Luxury Traveler"}, "history": [{"id": "72390", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d719675-Reviews-Launceston_Place-London_England.html", "review_date": "March 25, 2019", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Exceptional", "review": "Located on an unassuming picture postcard South Kensington Street, Launceston Place is understated Michelin level cuisine at an affordable price.

Some of the descriptions of the food, spices, and inspirations for the dishes were a little unfamiliar coming from a Korean influence, but the food definitely gives a sense of place. Each dish was flawless, although the Mackerel dish was a little too fishy for our taste. (Our mistake for never having had Mackerel before.) The Octopus was delicious; tender and perfect. The Bossam (pork belly rice) was beautifully porky without being greasy. The Sea Bream was delicate and flavorful. I would recommend the Galbi (pork ribs), but you can also have them on W 32nd probably just as good but not on such a pretty plate. The desserts were works of art that were as tasty as they were beautiful. The Jang Dok were little kimchi pots made of ganache which was a nice way for the chef to tell his story. Likewise for the Harubang, by far the prettiest plate. I wish there was a little bit more light so we could have enjoyed the beauty of these plates. Wine list is excellent. The service was spot-on and polished, although a little reserved. We were able to warm up our servers a little by asking some questions and they showed some personality."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tsmayda", "user_id": "tsmayda", "user_name": "tsmayda", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Clearwater, Florida", "user_nb_contributions": 44.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 290.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 81.0, "user_nb_photos": 35.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Like a Local;History Buff"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "7245", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d10514254-Reviews-Les_Apotres_de_Pigalle-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "review_date": "July 6, 2019", "review_city": "Paris, France", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Hidden gem", "review": "We were looking for some tapas and found this place on TA, I called to book and shutters were partially down, I called under in my best Bonjour, one of the brothers who own the restaurant invited me in and took the booking, we had a wonderful selection of tapas and wine, it\u2019s quite small so it is best to pre book, the staff are very helpful and explain the menu and options very well, definitely worth a visit if you like tapas."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nitrammcc", "user_id": "nitrammcc", "user_name": "nitrammcc", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Coleraine, United", "user_nb_contributions": 73.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 43.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 92.0, "user_nb_photos": 21.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Nightlife Seeker;Thrifty Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "7246", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293734-d13075650-Reviews-Cafe_Babouche-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html", "review_date": "March 31, 2022", "review_city": "Marrakech, Morocco", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "SUPER FOOD and ATMOSPHERE !", "review": "Great food and Atmosphere!

There were two small tables on the ground floor with the main open kitchen behind them. On the first floor there were10 small tables for 4 people each.  Be prepared to wait a while as the food is freshly prepared. It is worth the wait as the food is delicious. I have been there on two occasions and on both time there was only one waitress who spoke very good English and was rushed off her feet. The local dish which I chose called Tajine was lovely. I chose a Tajine chicken which had fresh vegetables - runner beans, potatoes, carrots, olives (photo enclosed). This was my first Moroccan dish and I was not disappointed.  On the second time I had a freshly made pizza and it was just as enjoyable as the traditional Moroccan dish. Everything on it was fresh and it tasted wonderful. It tasted better than the ones that I had in Rome and Sicily.  This little restaurant gets very busy. I would highly recommend going early as possible otherwise there can be an hour waiting time. Diners do seem to be in a hurry to leave.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}]}}, {"id": "7274", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d719852-Reviews-Pur_Jean_Francois_Rouquette-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "review_date": "June 15, 2013", "review_city": "Paris, France", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Fantastic.. if money is no object", "review": "The food and service were both superb and I cannot criticise the craft of the chef and the attention of the staff.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "72838", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

We don't know what the \"house\" is like except through reviews, but the \"holiday\" version is in a first floor restaurant-like commercial space that did not convey \"house.\" It was modern, clean and well lit for sure, but it holds 25 people so that's quite a crowd. On our particular night, half of the crowd was a group that already knew each other so they sat together on one half of the long communal table. They didn't really mingle as, well, they didn't have to. So there was less over-all mingling than we were hoping for. That said, the non-group people around us were delightful, engaged and pleasantly interactive (folks were from all over the world). The food itself, however, was AMAZING, the best or near best meal of our 12 day trip to Argentina. Luis is a bit soft spoken but he gives a nice introduction about the elements of a \"proper asado\" before he fires up the grills and then another member of his team, a highly fluent (in english) young man who is well versed not only in food but politics and culture, acts as host and service captain. Every course is outstanding. The wine pairings well chosen, and the pours generous. Luis circulates a bit as things progress, which is nice. By 11pm when the dinner ended, the lack of intimacy had softed a bit due to the otherwise happy experience. If you are travelling during the winter holidays, check the website or inqure to see if they are doing this larger group thing again.

The toughest decision is whether to have the wine pairing (4 glasses), or not. Have it.  The 7-course meal is presented slowly, and beautifully. It takes about 2 to 3 hours to get though dinner, and each course is fairly small. So although it may sound like 7 dishes is a lot, it feels perfect.  The restaurant, operated by the Kimsan Twins (I don't think they are actually twins), is entirely staffed by women.

You could never accuse this venue of being cozy or intimate, it's too spacious for that but it's a very pleasant dining environment nevertheless. Our last visit had been on a Saturday night in May when we had been surprised at how many empty tables there were. This occasion a Monday night in November the reverse was true with most tables occupied, even early in the evening. Our service from Roald was excellent and we hope that he remembers his promise to ensure that we can have zucchini flowers stuffed with mozzarella on our next visit in January! Our food [ starters Italian cold meat platter and Burrata followed by lamb rack and lobster pasta] were very good although considering the price, I felt that bearing in mind the usual generosity of portions in this restaurant the lobster on my pasta was a bit thin on the ground.

For the second night, and after a very long day of touring the city, we decided to have dinner at The Red Bean. Greeted by friendly staff at the lift door, we were ushered to an intimate table and offered a menu with a great selection of dishes and drinks including cocktails. For cocktails we had: The Naked Man Pina Colada Both very moorish, so we had seconds at the end of our meal! We would recommend the spring rolls platter which had two fresh rolls, two crispy seafood rolls and two crispy Hanoi pork rolls. This was followed by a beautifully presented steaming bowl of pho. The pho at the restaurant was a delicately flavoured broth with rice noodles and tender beef. It was different to the rustic flavours you\u2019d get from street food vendors and equally as wonderful. Every pho recipe has some hidden secrets and this was evident in the subtlety different flavours. Mango sticky rice wrapped up the evening and the warm coconut flavoured rice with sweet mango was everything that I was expecting and looking forward to trying for the first time. It was a great restaurant choice for our last night in Hanoi and if we are ever here again we will definitely visit."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/N3070KIjamesh", "user_id": "N3070KIjamesh", "user_name": "James H", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Kent, United", "user_nb_contributions": 53.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 27.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 73.0, "user_nb_photos": 13.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Urban Explorer;Shopping Fanatic"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "72140", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293924-d17623445-Reviews-Tung_s_Kitchen-Hanoi.html", "review_date": "April 3, 2023", "review_city": "Hanoi, Vietnam", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Very Attentive Staffs, Vegetarian food available", "review": "Very attentive staffs.

Decent food, nothing really outstanding! Mediocre Wines.", "review": "We had an OK night at casa SaltShaker, but in the end it was a disappointmet, because we  expected MUCH more.  First of all, the food was ok - there's nothing to complain about. However, it wasn't anyting really special. This is definitely NOT world class, in a city famous for its abundance of world class restaurants. Of course, this insight was a disappointment!  The best way to describe what I mean is:  If I was invited to a hobby cook's house and he cooked such a meal, it would be great. If however somebody pretending to be a knowledgable chef invited me to his and cooked this menu for me, I would clearly think that he was not trying nearly as hard as he could, but was saving efforts...  The Casa Saltshaker guys are definitely to be attributed to the hobby cook area...the problem is that TA rates them in the other category (and they think that they belong there...)  The HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT was however was the complete abscence of any personal interaction on behalf of the \"hosts\". When you \"invite\" somebody into your home and you do not wish to exchange even a word with your \"guests\", this is really a bummer. I had the feeling that they were desperate to put us through the process as quickly as possible, collect our money and send us home.  I certainly didn't feel welcome there.  Exemplatory for the attitude towards their guest was this episode:  Coming in I was thirsty and aksed for a glass of water. They rejected it by saying that they would start serving dinner in 10min. REALLY!? Is THAT hospitality?! No one had ever before denied me a glass of water :-)  Making up for the desaster that our hosts were was a quite nice mix of guests with whom we've had a fun evening anyway, despite the hosts (unfortunately not because of them :-)  Last but not least, the wine \"pairing\" we had with the meal was mediocre. We have had wine pairings in good places in Buenos Aires, so we know what can be expected in this price range. The guys either don't have a clue about wine or they simply don't care (I suppose it's the latter, because it fits the overall picture)."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kamen_777", "user_id": "Kamen_777", "user_name": "Kamen_777", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Sofia, Bulgaria", "user_nb_contributions": 332.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 221.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 231.0, "user_nb_photos": 13.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Like a Local;Nature Lover;Peace and Quiet Seeker"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "72161", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d2244333-Reviews-Sitara-London_England.html", "review_date": "January 7, 2018", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Might well be the best Indian in London", "review": "I recently moved to Archway and The Sitara was immediately suggested to me.

The wine by the glass was good, but served only by the deciliter. And the dessert menu was too limited for us. We would have had a dessert, but they were only two sweet desserts and a cheese plate. We went home to have our own. Would definitely recommend this restaurant and we hope to return!"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/jcrane66", "user_id": "jcrane66", "user_name": "John Crane", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Prague, Czech", "user_nb_contributions": 436.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 68.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 307.0, "user_nb_photos": 16.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;History Buff"}, "history": [{"id": "721760", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d3835034-Reviews-Blue_Wagon-Prague_Bohemia.html", "review_date": "December 19, 2021", "review_city": "Prague, Czech Republic", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "A wonderful evening from start to finish", "review": "We went to the Blue Wagon to start the holiday season here in Prague.

The one next door is called the Charnery Tree and only serves the Khmer version. Sokkhak River, however, also has a French Fusion menu as well as tables inside with air conditioning, whereas Chanery Tree only has tables outside. As it wax another hot day in Siem Reap I opted to eat insid.  The French menu is really a Western menu offering mostly steaks, seafood and pasta main dishes for around $20-25. The Khmer menu is about half that price and looked much more interesting offering local classics like Amok, Lok Lak as well as the temptingly exotic Grilled Stuffed Frog, but as I was feeling less adventurous I opted for the Tonle Sap Steamed Fish ($11.50); Bar fish fillet with garlic, shallot, basil, spring onion, cashew and lime dressing. To drink with lunch I ordered a glass of the Obikwa Chardonnay from South Africa. Like all the red and white wines by the glass this cost $5.80.  The Chardy was nice - quite a lot of body with pear flavours. An easy drinking cheap and cheerful! The Sokkhak is very comfortable and stylish. There are two red and black display cases filled with small potted tropical plants, statues and other knick knacks that subtly divide the space in two, black tiled floors, contemporary local art on the walls, and dark wood sideboards where the settings are kept. I had a table near one of the windows that looked out onto a narrow breezeway filled with ferns that separated the restaurant from its sister property next door.  My main was delivered quickly and was very good. The fish was tasty and soft, and the sauce tart and flavoursome but not so much as to over power the main ingredient. The cashews added a nice crunch to an otherwise soft-mouthed dish. I think I did a good job matching the wine too as this complemented the dish very well.  I'd had the tasting menu at another high end restart just next door called Malis a couple of nights before which I really liked, but a couple of locals said this place was better. Personally I liked them both, but it's hard to compare the diverse tastes and experience of a degustation against a single dish. However based on the one I tried here today I'd have to call it a tie. I'd really like Chanery Tree/Sokkhak to introduce a tasting plate to their menu as there were a lot of things they do that I'd really like to try - starting, of course, with the stuffed frog"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kst01231", "user_id": "kst01231", "user_name": "kst01231", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Frankfurt, Germany", "user_nb_contributions": 115.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 174.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 202.0, "user_nb_photos": 19.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Urban Explorer;History Buff"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "72181", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d3835034-Reviews-Blue_Wagon-Prague_Bohemia.html", "review_date": "December 10, 2015", "review_city": "Prague, Czech Republic", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "very special place", "review": "took my parents there. the atmosphere is fantastic.

When we had visited this restaurant, several years back, we were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance and quality of food. So when we arrived in NYC this 4th of July weekend, Utsav was the 1st restaurant that came to mind for Indian food. I made a reservation to make sure we had a place.  We arrived with a lot of anticipation, but were utterly disappointed, by the time we left.  The restaurant started us of on the wrong foot, by stacking up unclean plates. Every plate we picked up (from the stack of plates provided) had food particles stuck to the bottom. Either their dishwasher was spoilt, or whoever was washing the dishes, did a shoddy job. I had to pick through at least 10 plates (supposedly clean) before getting hold of a \u201csomewhat clean plate\u201d.  At the Appetizer counter, there was a man preparing chat. I asked him for a helping, and was told that they will bring it to our table. By the time we left, no one had bothered to get us the chat.  The food quality was well below average, and not commensurate of a restaurant charging over $20/person for the buffet. There were very few items, both for the vegetarian and the non-vegetarian palate. The food tasted like \u201cproduction line\u201d preparation. There were two desert dishes that were clearly below par.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Indian food.

There were only four entr\u00e9es to choose from and one was a cheese platter. The other entr\u00e9e choices were sea bass , wyagu beef and sweet breads. My husband wanted none of them however he chose the wyagu beef. The sauce for the beef was excellent and he enjoyed it however at \u20ac135 it should be more than very good . I ordered the Seabass and found it adequate. The risotto with curry that came with the beef also had an excellent sauce. Some of the servers, including James and Amin, were very good. Leopold never brought the citrus vinaigrette I requested and seemed to completely forget it. He also had to be asked to serve us bread. There were many \u201cextras\u201d that were provided at no charge,but being very gourmet,required a receptive palate. I loved the artichoke appetizer bite with curry,but my husband didn\u2019t care for any of them. We ordered a la carte,but with a \u20ac90 bottle of wine ( which was the least expensive Bordeaux on the menu) and coffee, our bill before tip was \u20ac333. We are world travelers and have stayed at some of the best hotels. Overall, I would give the food a B-. My husband gave it a much lower rating than that. If we had ordered the six course fixed menu with wine, the bill would have been well over \u20ac600. You would have had the same four entrees as well. Interesting experience, but we would never go back."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dsg76", "user_id": "dsg76", "user_name": "dsg76", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Stuart, Florida", "user_nb_contributions": 229.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 448.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 160.0, "user_nb_photos": 7.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Like a Local;History Buff;Shopping Fanatic"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "72193", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d3836234-Reviews-New_Hope_Cambodia_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "January 30, 2014", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Great Meal Supporting Great Cause", "review": "Run by the New Hope founder's wife, this excellent restaurant serves as a training ground for the school's students without sacrificing quality.

The various fruit shakes are awesome, and I was impressed with the quality of their gourmet coffee selections (and I am VERY picky in this area).  The system behind this NGO facility is most impressive. A large number of volunteers assist the school regularly, but at its core lie a dedicated staff of locals committed to developing Cambodia's youth. The more you learn about the cause, the more you will want to seek this incredible restaurant out.

At first, as someone who lives in Hanoi, I was turned off by the idea that it's almost on Hoan Kiem lake. I thought it would be a tourist trap. It's not. And, the fact that you have to go down a tiny little alley and up a flight of stairs just adds to the awesomeness of the experience. From that alley, you emerge into a bright, cheerful and welcoming little shop. There's great outdoor seating if the weather is good and there's cool, clean air conditioning inside if that's your fancy. The staff was incredibly nice and talked me through the process for selecting my bowl. It was absolutely delicious. And, the fresh orange carrot juice was great too.  And, one of the key reasons that I'm giving this place 5-stars (and not just because everyone else seems to) is that they are also very ecologically aware. They offer bamboo straws, bamboo chopsticks and wooden spoons. All of the cutlery was therefore biodegradable or reusable. I loved that.

Not only is it delicious, but it is greatvalue for money. \u00a320pp gets you the grande selection - a tapas-style offering of nearly everything on the menu. It's more food than we could eat (and boy did we try!). Favourite dishes included the cashew cheeze, the homemade pakoras and the two curry dishes.  You get free top ups of any dish you want (we couldn't manage that) and they give you doggy bags to take away your left overs. The vegan brownie we had for dessert was TO DIE FOR. Oh how can it be so rich and crispy and gooey all at once, and accompanied by delicious vegan ice cream.  You bring your own booze but we also tried the delicious complimentary tea at the end. They were also kind enough to give us little pots of the tea mix to try at home!  The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, with everyone cooing when their selections arrived, and the staff were incredibly lovely and helpful.

The location and set up is very nice, and having a meal beside the beach with the crashing waves in the background is very romantic and soaking with atmosphere and style.  Service: The service was exemplary as expected at an Anantara. Attentive, helpful, and unobtrusive. They were kind enough to help move us inside to the air conditioned space which helped when it became too hot. They explained much of the dishes to us as well which was nice. When we left they got us a buggy to the reception and called our hotel and asked them to send a buggy to collect us. We were very impressed and pleased with this.  Food: The menu is very limited with only a few options for starters, mains and desserts. I was hoping for more seafood dishes and options. Their hallmark dish was seafood cooked on top of salt bricks. Heating the bricks and cooking it on top allows the seafood to absorb some of the flavour of the exotic salts. It felt gimmicky and I could not really taste any great benefit. I ordered the prawn version and it tasted like regular grilled prawns and was nothing special. I hoped to have some of the famous Thai flavours and passion reflected in the food. But I found the meal a bit bland. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the food was fresh and all was very well executed but the mains were really not that interesting. The salt sommelier was there to assist with different types of salt to enhance your meal. I am a fan of interesting salts but again, this felt a bit forced. I could barely tell the difference between the salts and quite frankly, didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to really good, tasty seafood. The starters were very good \u2013 most especially the rocket and pear salad which was quite WOW but a very small portion. The desserts were nicely made but nothing extraordinary. There was also a seafood feast but for the price, did not seem well worth it.  Price: This place was very expensive. I dont normally mind paying for good food but this felt unnecessarily expensive for what it was. I love Ananatra as a hotel and frequently dine at their restaurants even when I am not staying with them but the pricing of the is menu felt much too expensive for the food you were getting. Even if the price were lower, I would not be keen to come back again as I don\u2019t find the food (except the salad) worth the inflated cost. It is a rarity that I do not like an Anantara establishment but the balance of value for money for atmosphere \u2013 made me feel disappointed.  I would not go back again for dinner as nothing interested my taste buds. I would not mind to have a drink or light snack there but as a dinner, I felt I could get better food, variety and price at one of the other dining options on the hotel property."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMausH", "user_id": "TMausH", "user_name": "TMausH", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "London, United", "user_nb_contributions": 228.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 137.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 171.0, "user_nb_photos": 35.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Luxury Traveler;Family Vacationer"}, "history": [{"id": "722480", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d796599-Reviews-Benihana_Chelsea-London_England.html", "review_date": "January 12, 2017", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "For entertainment, not for the food", "review": "I have never been much of a fan of teppanaki food for the taste as it is inevitably bland and boring. Benihana is a legend in the teppanyaki cuisine and for what it is, it\u2019s fine. This is a place for food theatre where people go with their kids / friends for a fun evening.  Service \u2013 the service is good at this Benihana. The reception was nice and efficient and the waitresses are nice, drinks and non-teppanaki items served quickly and they did a good job with special requests on the table. Chefs were fun, engaged the kids and put on a good show for everyone.  Food \u2013 Ordered the cod with miso and a side of scallops. The fish was good enough, but the miso was added as a sauce (vs glazed on top) which was disappointing. The unique black cod taste was lost on the grill and the luscious oiliness of the fish was lost. My son ordered beef and eat everything as it was served medium so soft to eat in bite size pieces so he liked it. I am not a fan of the food and only attended on the request of my son.  Value \u2013 teppanyaki is always expensive. My young son and I had 2 mains, 1 starter and a glass of wine and it cost us \u00a390. Every time I pay the bill for a teppanyaki dinner, I vow never to come back and year after year the kids beg to come back for the show which obviously made the meal delicious to them.  Benhihana does the teppanyaki show well and kids and groups will enjoy the experience. It seems fully booked all the time so there is certainly an audience for it. But it is not good value for money, and the food is uninteresting and bland (even with their sauce options). If the kids have a great desire to go then we may consider going back, but never for any other reason."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 2.0}}]}}, {"id": "72249", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d11880648-Reviews-The_Christa_Restaurant_Bar-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "February 19, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "VERY good food and good price", "review": "I went here with a vegan friend and got the recommendation of Tripadvisor.

We have traveled to India and are frequent diners at the small places in Edison, NJ (little India) -- places where you get wow (but definitely NOT atmosphere cheap). Utsav is very convenient to theaters, and has a prix fixe menu. We did a combo of small plates, entrees and dessert. The small plates were both excellent -- traditional samosas and a quinoa potato patty. The mains less so. The menu has a combination of traditional and different, and my husband's Baingan Bharta (eggplant) was enjoyable. I had the Shrimp Goa, which was supposed to come in a coconut sauce. It was basically Shrimp Tikka Masala, and it was overcooked. I mean to the point of tough. I've had that issue in Indian places before, but that is a rookie mistake to be sure. Short on time I did not send it back, but also did not love it. The dessert was again quite good, a traditional kheer but with coconut sorbet in the middle. The entire meal cost $150 for 3 people (tax and tip included -- no alcohol). In Edison it's usually about $65 and we have tons left over.

IL PUNTO showed up at the top of the list. After reading many of the reviews, I decided to give it a try and made a reservation through OpenTable.  Was thoroughly impressed from the time I stepped inside. (Don't let the appearance of the exterior cause you any concern.) The place is small but well-managed. Several tables were full (7:00pm) and our reserved table was ready and waiting. The owner/manager greeted us and promptly seated us. From that point on, service was excellent. The menu (authentic Italian) was full of fantastic choices and made it difficult to pick an entr\u00e9e. On the server's suggestion, I tried the cauliflower soup appetizer. It was exceptional. My main course, ravioli with lobster meat was a good choice, too.  Overall, the group enjoyed the meal with numerous complements on the food.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "722768", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

Need Better Desserts (3.5 Stars).", "review": "During my stay in Paris, I wanted to have at least one fine dining experience. I chose Pur' since it was a Michelin starred restaurant and they were open on a Sunday. Many French restaurants are closed on Sundays, so I was happy to find a one that was open. You should make a reservation. If I remember correctly, I think I made mine about a month in advance. The restaurant is located in the Hyatt hotel.  The ambiance is very nice. Typical of many hotel restaurants. However, it had a more loungey, but classy, feel which I found relaxing and nice. I liked the lounge like seating as opposed to rows of tables and chairs.  Come dressed nice - you do not have to be too formal - no gowns. But dress as you would when you go to a special occasion at church or formal work function.  I had the 6 course pre-fixe with wine pairings which included:  - Monkfish, Fennel, and Sweet Potato dish - Duck Foie Gras with Green Beans, and Quinoa in a Yogurt/Horseradish Sauce - Beef with Potatoes - A few dessert dishes  The staff was very accommodating to my friends peanut allergy, so I am unsure if the selections are in line with what they actual offer on their menu. I let them know during the reservation period and when we got there, they were very attentive to ensure that they met our dietary needs. In general, the service was superb. I feel confident in saying that it was the best service I had in Paris. Very professional and polite staff.  The wine pairings were superb. Everything paired well nicely. I did not like the port with dessert. However, that is not held against the restaurant as port is considered a dessert drink. I personally just don't care for port. Especially not with dessert. Not sure where that rule was established. lol.  I was a huge fan of all the entrees. It is very difficult for me to pick a favorite. I guess I would have to say the Monkfish. However, the Duck Foie Gras and Beef were cooked perfectly. I loved the layers of flavors. They were hearty without being heavy. They were nicely presented as well. The entrees itself would give this restaurant a 5 stars.  I gave 3.5 tar because of the desserts. I did not care much for the desserts. In fact, I do not think I really remember any of them. They consisted a big portion of the meal (8 in total I think). I do think I had a dessert with brie - and I remember eating it. This says a lot because no one can get me to eat brie. I usually do not have the pallet for it (it's possible it wasn't brie). But generally, the desserts were not memorable.  As an American, and this being my first fine dining experience of this caliber, it was difficult for me to get used to the tiny food. I am big into nutrition, and technically, the food is perfect portion sizes. However, it didn't prevent me from wanting a juicy turkey burger afterwards. I did not leave full.  I stopped at the restaurant bar after dinner. They had some very unique cocktails. I ordered the \"Puki Puki\" simply because I liked the name. It was a very beautiful and tastey cocktail. Very tastey cocktail - more memorable than the dinner wine. I vote that all restaurants should offer cocktail pairings with pre-fixe dinner. That would be nice!  The 6-course pre-fixe will run you about 235 Euro - not bad considering some other fine dining resteraunts were almost double."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelhoneyBL", "user_id": "Courtney T", "user_name": "Courtney T", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "25-34", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Frederick, Maryland", "user_nb_contributions": 64.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 59.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 31.0, "user_nb_photos": 185.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Urban Explorer;Like a Local"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "72289", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255122-d6953388-Reviews-Pedro_s_House_Of_Lamb_Queenstown-Queenstown_Otago_Region_South_Island.html", "review_date": "April 6, 2018", "review_city": "Queenstown, New Zealand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Best lamb ever", "review": "Lamb and scalloped potato was amazing!

The service is the best you will find in Siem Reap and the food is exceptional. You have the choice of a two or three course set menu of western or Asian persuasion or a selection of a la carte dishes.  I can't recommend this restaurant more highly. It's such a great social project - but the food and service cannot be faulted - so it's a win win choice."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/samanthamorriswrites", "user_id": "samanthamorriswrites", "user_name": "Samantha Morris", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Broadbeach, Australia", "user_nb_contributions": 69.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 133.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 81.0, "user_nb_photos": 33.0, "user_tags": "Urban Explorer;Like a Local;Nature Lover;Eco-tourist"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "72299", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d7805494-Reviews-Bayon_Pastry_School_Coffee_Shop-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 29, 2016", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Exquisite crossaint layering", "review": "'Nuf said.

We had been put into a private room away from the main area - which we were glad about as it was extremely loud in the main restaurant. The cocktails list is poor - most sound fairly unappetising and the only few we tried were not great & we wouldn't have ordered a 2nd. One had an ice cube in which was the size of the glass so was an utter rip off for what you receive. Once at the table, we asked for the wine list which was apparently non-existent as the waitress came back & read 7 wines from her notepad (not being able to tell us anything about any of them)! She explained they were between wine lists, however even if this is the case its fairly poor for any restaurant to not be able to manage this smoothly. We opted for the safe option of Prosecco and beers - after our 2nd bottle of Prosecco, none of the rest of the bottles were cold which the waitress seemed pretty embarrassed about. She also managed to spill half a glass over my friend when pouring it out. The food was ok, we ordered starters to share (the prawns were tasty) and each ordered a main with some vegetables to share too. At the point of mains, you are basically paying for the spectacle only as the portions are fairly small & food is fairly bland & overcooked. I had the seafood special & the salmon was the best thing since its such an oily fish it could take the extra cooking. The lobster was unfortunately a bit chewy. The egg fried rice was also very blend. Each person also got a pair of ramekins with a couple of sauces - these were not nice & didn't compliment the fish at all, one being overly mustardy - assumably to go with steak. For the entainment value, its a bit of fun with a group of friends but I wouldn't go here just for the food. It was also very expensive for what it is - our bill was over \u00a3120 per person by the end, which was without desserts & there were a few people driving. I would rather spend that sort of money knowing I'm going to get much better food & service. Unfortunately, we won't be returning and I wouldn't recommend to any food lovers thinking of going."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sus86london", "user_id": "sus86london", "user_name": "sus86london", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "25-34", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Hertfordshire, United", "user_nb_contributions": 168.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 125.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 166.0, "user_nb_photos": 4.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Peace and Quiet Seeker;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "72303", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293734-d12328096-Reviews-Dar_Chef-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html", "review_date": "January 6, 2018", "review_city": "Marrakech, Morocco", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "A pearl inside Marrakech", "review": "Having been to many restaurants in Marrakech, the Dar Chef was one of the best in quality of the food and the service, whilst being one of the cheapest.
