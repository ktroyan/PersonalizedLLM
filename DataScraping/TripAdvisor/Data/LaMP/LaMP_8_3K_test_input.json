Tender and succulent, with delicious shavings of crispy garlic in the sauce.  We asked for tap water and were given filtered water and charged 1.50 euro.

The portion size of the first course was huge, and could have warranted for being half the size. Our choice of mains, although different I thought tasted very much the same. The chicken was a little chewy and we just couldn't get excited about it. The service was also just ok, not very personal and not very engaging.

We all chose this dessert and all left it. The experience and all the other food was superb!

Food was good, not great. Good list of French wines.  We started with charcuterie and cheese plate. About on par with Boar's Head cold cuts and supermarket cheese-counter cheese. Nothing special, nothing especially French and pricey at $31.  I ordered the lamb. After 30 minutes of waiting, the waiter came back and said \"we're out of lamb.\" Huh? After 30 minutes? Anyway, I ordered the cheeseburger which was made with short-rib meat and was tasty. But nothing French about it at all.  We then ordered dessert: Tarte tatin (apple pie of the south of France), classically served with vanilla ice cream. The waiter came back, this time after 15 minutes, and said they're out of vanilla ice cream. Again, Huh? He offered to serve it with chocolate ice cream. Well, both the pie and the ice cream were fine.  So... OK food but not special. Inept service. Unappealing, loud room. Expensive for what it is.  We won't be back.

I'm not sure I can put down in word how excellent our visit was, but I would honestly say this was the highlight of a very touristy weekend in Paris.  From start to finish this was amazing - we both went for the 6 course taster menu which was easily 11/12 courses and I've not been so full in a restaurant of this quality before! I will say this is a comfortable level of fine dining - the menu and ingredients are not massively intricate yet the results are mind blowing.  The level of service was perfect. My wife for example could not entertain the idea of pigeon (which was beautiful!) which was substituted for beef (also spot on). At 145\u20ac the food worked out with the various amuse-bouche etc at less than \u00a310 per course. Wine/champagne did add a bit to the overall bill as expected in a hotel restaurant but to be honest I felt the evening was worth every penny.  The highlight would have to be the monkfish which was cooked to perfection. The chocolate experience near the end is a must for cocoa lovers! My only issue would be that with a glance at the bill at the end of the night I assumed 20% service had been added and it was only afterwards that I realised two levels of tax (for food and alcohol) had been applied, so actually left without tipping! If anyone at the restaurant reads this, apologies for not concentrating enough in French class!! I hope there is a next time when I can double tip!"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dadio77", "user_id": "dadio77", "user_name": "dadio77", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Bromsgrove, United", "user_nb_contributions": 137.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 182.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 91.0, "user_nb_photos": 4.0, "user_tags": "Urban Explorer;Shopping Fanatic;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "7267", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312741-d1856831-Reviews-St_Regis_Restaurant-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html", "review_date": "March 19, 2019", "review_city": "Buenos Aires, Argentina", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Great Buffet Selections and Service", "review": "The St. Regis Restaurant was a treat.

Mirek responded to all of my emails not only very quickly but also in English which of course is not his native tongue. The restaurant is quite a long way out from the centre of Prague, but as we were not staying in the centre and were the right side of Prague for this particular restaurant, it was only about a 15 mins taxi ride which we booked via our hotel. Mirek was very friendly and welcoming and very helpful with recommendations and advice - both on the menu and on Prague. The food was beautifully presented and tasted awesome! As it was a special birthday meal, we had 3 courses (rabbit and lamb for main courses) together with a bottle of wine, a dessert wine, a digestif and a coffee and it came to around \u00a370 all in for 2 of us which we felt very reasonable given the quality of the food. The choice on the menu was plentiful and they brought rustic artisan bread with a pork pate to nibble on whilst choosing our dishes. There was something for everybody wanting to eat true Czech food. This is not your English chicken & chips pub nor a czech menu for tourists. This is a quality restaurant serving quality food for a special occasion - just what we wanted on my 50th birthday celebration and we couldn't have chosen a better place. The service was excellent and it was very busy. In fact they were fully booked on a Friday evening - out of season - so I would highly recommend pre-booking as we saw people being turned away. Quite a lot of local Czech diners too which I always think is a good sign. We would not hesitate to recommend this restaurant for a special occasion and we would definitely return. Thank you Mirek!

It is a small, cozy restaurant, where you share tables with other guests. But you have enough room to not feel close up against other diners. The two servers were wonderfully helpful, explained the menu in English, gave you a welcoming shot and went out of their way to help you have a great dining experience. We had four of the tapas dishes between us: truffle mac n cheese (delicious, my favourite), ceviche of the day, in our case salmon, (my husbands favourite), the chicken quesadilla, and the sweet potato fries. We then also had the cheese and meat board which had a great selection. We didn't save room for dessert. We also had 5 glasses of wine between us, we were there for their happy hour so they were half price! All of that for the best meal we had in Paris and it came to less than 65\u20ac!

Actually everything was more than ok - so delicious! Try their pastilla - thinnest filo pastry almond and chicken pie - it's so good. I've had the Gazelles tagine sweet/salty, loved and ate everything. Reasonable priced - our bill for 2 people based on main course, 2 mint teas and 1 starter shared came to 230 Dirhams that is equivalent to \u00a318.

We weren\u2019t allowed to sit and enjoy a drink however as we were rushed off to our table with a warning about how soon we would have to vacate the table. Not exactly welcoming  Eventually a waitress came and took a drinks order and gave us menus.  Long wait then she came and took our orders and a while later we finally got a drink. In the us where they live on tips this would never have happened  The chef was Spanish and very difficult to understand. In fact the other three in my party had to ask me what he was saying.  The display was almost non existent. Other benihanas have always put on a real show with food being flicked around, a few ingredients and utensils in the air etc  As for the food each part of the food was served individually so apart from the soup it was all pretty cold  A few selected comments  The fish was tasteless The chicken was dry The prawns were tasteless The rice was tasteless. This was REALLY surprising as we have always rated benihanas as having the best fried rice anywhere.  I\u2019ve never seen egg fried rice cooked this way before. First cook the egg into a well cooked omelette making sure it\u2019s tough. The add the rice. Everywhere else the egg is used to bind the rice  I would have asked for the 12.5% service charge to be replaced by a -12.5% lack of service charge but did not want to make a fuss as the staff seemed distant and just doing their job rather than making an effort to provide a high quality experience for their guests  Hopefully you will find this honest feedback useful in improving your uk offering"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Davebwiseman", "user_id": "Davebwiseman", "user_name": "Davebwiseman", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "65+", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Droitwich, United", "user_nb_contributions": 138.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 60.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 77.0, "user_nb_photos": 5.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;History Buff;60+ Traveler;Peace and Quiet Seeker"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "72113", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d1903700-Reviews-IL_Punto_Ristorante-New_York_City_New_York.html", "review_date": "November 6, 2018", "review_city": "New York City, United States", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "It was a late night dinner", "review": "I had an appointment after a meeting that finished at 8:00 pm and my guest expressed an interest in pasta.

It\u2019s a little bit cramped, but it\u2019s so popular I can\u2019t blame them for accommodating as many people as possible. We weren\u2019t keen on the high seats at barrel tables that we were initially allocated, but there was no problem at all in offering us alternative seating at a table. So, onto the food! It\u2019s simply exceptional. The ordering process is such a great idea, with you ticking the boxes next to your choices. We had 5 veggie & vegan dishes that were absolutely superb. In fact the beet hummus with chicory dressed with fig balsamic was one of the best things I\u2019ve ever eaten! My husband and son also had a fish dish and desserts, which they said were equally outstanding. Finally, we couldn\u2019t believe how hard the 2 owners worked.

This restaurant, like the name suggests, is a small kitchen, (with the 4 chef's busy within, which you can see clearly from the dining area). Whilst small they cram in a lot of guests, which ordinarily if in any other restaurant you would probably think (\"This is too cramped\") BUT at this restaurant it totally works and just adds to the amazing Italian party atmosphere that this place has, it really was fabulous and fun. The food was some of the best Italian I have ever eaten... The meatballs with mushroom and truffle to start was just divine and the ricotta ravioli with mushroom and pieces of sausage was also a dish that I didn't want to end. Prices are not too bad either with a feast of a dinner with a bottle of wine costing US$420 for 7 people.

Two of us ordered the Meze and the other two ordered the set Mixed Grill option with the three dish cold starters and between the four of us we shared all dishes. The food was very fresh and tasty, one of the better Mezes that I have had in a Greek restaurant, not overwhelming in size and very good value. The Meze had the added bonus of Kleftico (a speciality dish - the lamb melted in your mouth), which is usually not the norm but a very pleasant addition.  Service in the most part was very good, we only had a little issue with the young waitress in that she did not give us a tap water when ordered and when asked for it, again it did not materialise until we asked one of the male waiters and then they immediately got it for us. Not sure if the young waitress could understand us, but this happened again when requesting more bread and the bill, she just went outside to serve someone else, but eventually both materialised. Other than that small issue the service was perfect. When the bill came the (owner I believe) gave us a complimentary shot of Amaretto each, which was a nice touch.

I keep going back and forth on my feelings about our dinner at Jungsik. On one hand the service was incredibly slow to start. Our greeting, drink order, and food order took a good amount of time. From the time we sat down to the time we left we were at Jungsik for 3 hours.  We decided to drink cocktails along with dinner and the cocktails were well crafted. For dinner we chose the Signature Tasting Menu. The meal started with an amuse bouche which represented Korean side dishes. These small bites were a beautiful start to dinner. We enjoyed a variety the flavors, textures, and scents.  Our 1st course was the OSETRA CAVIAR. The caviar was a good dish although not memorable. The 2nd dish was FOIE GRAS MANDOO (not dairy free so I decided to risk it with a lactaid pill). The Mandoo and the Japanese Wagyu were delicious but the star was the broth. The broth was scrumptious and satisfying. 3rd course was OCTOPUS. With it's perfect combination of crunchy exterior and tender inside this dish was outstanding. Our 4th dish was BLACK COD. Black Cod isn't usually my favorite but I found that this dish wasn't overly sweet so I enjoyed it. 5th dish was TUNA KIM BAP. This was probably the most inventive dish. The Kim Bap was rolled into a small cigar and was a wonderful taste and crunch. The 6th dish was GALBI. This dish confused me honestly. I still am not sure whether or not this was supposed to be served cold or not but it definitely was. I found it rather off putting and would have said something but there wasn't staff nearby. Next came OMIJA which means \"five flavors\", which are sweetness, sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and pungency. Enjoyable. The 8th dish was the start of dessert. My husband was given a Baby Banana which was actually a small pastry. Unfortunately, it didn't wow him. He felt the focus was more on the presentation that actual flavor. I was given Pears along with Pear Sorbet.  As a person with a dairy allergy, there are two desserts which always disappoint me from a fine dining establishments; fruit or sorbets. Other restaurants with the same amount of notification have stepped up and presented pastries and/or composed dishes to me. In addition to this I have to ask, where was the Korean influence? I basically ended up with pears tossed with cinnamon and sugar. The 9th course was the ROASTED CHESTNUT. Greg was presented with a bowl of roasted chestnuts (for show) and a chestnut truffle to eat. Unfortunately, Greg felt it was truly lacking any chestnut flavor. I was given a different sorbet (not thrilled again). To end the meal we were given a small bowl of petit fours. Luckily these were a combination of sweet flavors and textures that saved the ending of our dinner.  We enjoyed most of dinner but in comparison to other like restaurants we agreed we wouldn't return."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/WanderlustHrts", "user_id": "WanderlustHrts", "user_name": "WanderlustHrts", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Boston, Massachusetts", "user_nb_contributions": 369.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 218.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 302.0, "user_nb_photos": 155.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Urban Explorer;Like a Local"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "72142", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d796599-Reviews-Benihana_Chelsea-London_England.html", "review_date": "December 10, 2017", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "\u201cOutworn\u201d and still expensive", "review": "Negative: I found that the quality is not adequate to the price.

We tried quite a few of the cocktails off this menu because it was so good that we visited twice whilst on our trip to Prague. All the staff were really friendly and we got chatting to Jan at the bar on both visits, what a star he is.

I scoured through a lot of Indian restaurant reviews, recommendations etc online and finally settled on the Rajdoot. It was slightly out of the immediate area we were staying and despite a large selection of restaurants available that were closer to us, I took a chance and I'm so glad we did!  Upon arrival, the staff were very welcoming and friendly and continued to be throughout the duration of the evening.  The menu has a great selection of classic dishes and curries along with an ample choice of house specials. Both of us unable to choose, we asked the staff for recommendations and they sure did not let us down! Exceptional curries!  We were served the King Prawn Nobabi and the Bahari Lamb (would highly recommend both dishes). The lamb was incredibly tender and melt in the mouth and the sauces for both dishes were explosive in flavour and fragrant in aroma. We asked for our dishes to be made on the hotter side of the spice scale and they got it spot on.  The dishes are all freshly made to order and you can certainly taste that. Fresh, flavoursome and perfectly spiced to our liking. What more could you ask for?  The service throughout was efficient and non intrusive and we would not hesitate to come back here again next time we're even remotely close to the area.  The final bill was more than reasonable for what we had and we were even presented with a small digestif on the house, thank you!  Our meal was the highlight of our weekend and a perfect first night out since lockdown.  I hope more people get to try this little gem as they won't be disappointed.

The courtyard is beautifully elegant with a lovely water feature. Food and service were outstanding and they serve alcohol even in Ramadam. The restaurant is run by the same efficient,friendly guy who is the senior manager of the Riyad.

The owners are someliers/wine enthusiasts and offer a wine paring option with the menus where you can taste (copious, generous quantities) wines with each course; often 2 per course so that comparisons can be made...

The lava stone grill items we received looked super pretty, but tasted rather boring. Our waiter had recommended the same sauce to pretty much everything we inquired about. The value-for-money ratio here is .. well .. it is expensive ... this is a place less for foodies, but rather for people wanting to impress business partners or future parents-in-law. The atmosphere can be a tad stiff. What really bugged me was hearing wonderful Jazz music, unfortunately 2 different CDs from 2 different corners of the room (one was Sinatra, that much I could make out). And the last, unforgivable (but fixable) item: The free bread and butter: The butter is served in ugly single serve airline style packets (on a fancy saucer) and the bread rolls appear to be heated in a microwave, they turn to stone after 1 minute.

I guess I expect more haute cuisine but tastes of course differ. We decided to go for fixed price menu. I had mushroom soup with duck foie gras ravioli and steak tartare. Both dishes were very good with soup little less so due to somewhat hard dough used to prepare ravioli. We also had 1/2 bottle of pouilly-fume which was delicious. My wife had duck Pte in a crust (delicious) and deep fried whiting which was ok but very simple, basically a fish and chips without batter and chips.

We ordered the salmon fixed in Italian style, and the beef fixed in a different style. The meat was incredibly tasty and tender. We also ordered a side salad, that was merely fresh lettuce with a light vinegar and oil dressing, and French fries cooked in duck fat. For dessert, our waiter offered us a dessert not on the menu, which turned out to be very thinly sliced fresh pineapple with a dulce leche (caramel) sauce drizzled on it and little toffee crumbles. It was very good and refreshing. We ordered a bottle of wine recommended by the waiter that we quite enjoyed. We recommend this restaurant if you are ok with Tartare.

Indian food comes in many bowls and platters, so... About the food: wow. Just wow. So delicious! We eat Indian regularly, but this is #1 so far! We loved it!! We choose not spicy. Started with vegetable samosa and fried shrimps. Already very delicious. Then came the Dal Makhani: Black lentils cooked overnight in the Tandoor finished with tomato sauce & cream. A prawn curry; Tiger prawns in rich sauce with cashews and coconut and the Kashmiri Pulao: Rice mixed with sliced fruits and nuts flavored with aromatic cashmere herbs and cream. I had the pineapple raita and a cheese naan with it. Too much but O man. To die for. So good. So good. So, when in Prague avoid the busy squares and find K the two brothers in old town.

So to me, that's always a sign of an authentic ethnic restaurant outside the actual country it is trying to represent.  As you enter the restaurant, there's a very small (6 person maybe) bar in a street level lobby. Then you go up a flight of stairs to the restaurant. The layout is spacious, open, and has windows at each end of the room which makes the space seem even larger.  The food was fantastic! The wait staff was the only reason I didn't give 5 dots. They were 'very good' too, but not always friendly (we had three different waiters). And although they have a liquor license, we weren't offered the wine list or drinks. We had to ask. Which may be cultural, I don't know. But it was a bit odd.  I will be back.

Coconut shrimp was amazing - no wonder it's the signature dish. The fish in the tacos was very good, but sadly let down by the dressing, which was so wet it made the taco disintegrate very quickly.

Firstly the chef, the host and the server, were extremely warm and friendly people who could not do enough for you to make this a really exceptional experience. I can't possibly remember each course and they did come quickly although at the right time, other reviews said they felt rushed, this was not our experience at all and we found that each course was paced perfectly. I ate things I had never eaten before and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. As always there are a few things that could make the experience one notch higher. The restaurant is small and it was hot, we suggest LED bulbs and the owner did turn the lights down a little later in the evening. It is also a little noisy when you get that person who wants to tell everyone their news. Because the restaurant has hard surfaces, brick wall, high ceilings the noise bounces, so some soft sound absorbent panels hung from the ceiling horizontally might help with that.

The location and set up is very nice, and having a meal beside the beach with the crashing waves in the background is very romantic and soaking with atmosphere and style.  Service: The service was exemplary as expected at an Anantara. Attentive, helpful, and unobtrusive. They were kind enough to help move us inside to the air conditioned space which helped when it became too hot. They explained much of the dishes to us as well which was nice. When we left they got us a buggy to the reception and called our hotel and asked them to send a buggy to collect us. We were very impressed and pleased with this.  Food: The menu is very limited with only a few options for starters, mains and desserts. I was hoping for more seafood dishes and options. Their hallmark dish was seafood cooked on top of salt bricks. Heating the bricks and cooking it on top allows the seafood to absorb some of the flavour of the exotic salts. It felt gimmicky and I could not really taste any great benefit. I ordered the prawn version and it tasted like regular grilled prawns and was nothing special. I hoped to have some of the famous Thai flavours and passion reflected in the food. But I found the meal a bit bland. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the food was fresh and all was very well executed but the mains were really not that interesting. The salt sommelier was there to assist with different types of salt to enhance your meal. I am a fan of interesting salts but again, this felt a bit forced. I could barely tell the difference between the salts and quite frankly, didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to really good, tasty seafood. The starters were very good \u2013 most especially the rocket and pear salad which was quite WOW but a very small portion. The desserts were nicely made but nothing extraordinary. There was also a seafood feast but for the price, did not seem well worth it.  Price: This place was very expensive. I dont normally mind paying for good food but this felt unnecessarily expensive for what it was. I love Ananatra as a hotel and frequently dine at their restaurants even when I am not staying with them but the pricing of the is menu felt much too expensive for the food you were getting. Even if the price were lower, I would not be keen to come back again as I don\u2019t find the food (except the salad) worth the inflated cost. It is a rarity that I do not like an Anantara establishment but the balance of value for money for atmosphere \u2013 made me feel disappointed.  I would not go back again for dinner as nothing interested my taste buds. I would not mind to have a drink or light snack there but as a dinner, I felt I could get better food, variety and price at one of the other dining options on the hotel property."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMausH", "user_id": "TMausH", "user_name": "TMausH", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "London, United", "user_nb_contributions": 228.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 137.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 171.0, "user_nb_photos": 35.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Luxury Traveler;Family Vacationer"}, "history": [{"id": "722690", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d796599-Reviews-Benihana_Chelsea-London_England.html", "review_date": "January 12, 2017", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "For entertainment, not for the food", "review": "I have never been much of a fan of teppanaki food for the taste as it is inevitably bland and boring. Benihana is a legend in the teppanyaki cuisine and for what it is, it\u2019s fine. This is a place for food theatre where people go with their kids / friends for a fun evening.  Service \u2013 the service is good at this Benihana. The reception was nice and efficient and the waitresses are nice, drinks and non-teppanaki items served quickly and they did a good job with special requests on the table. Chefs were fun, engaged the kids and put on a good show for everyone.  Food \u2013 Ordered the cod with miso and a side of scallops. The fish was good enough, but the miso was added as a sauce (vs glazed on top) which was disappointing. The unique black cod taste was lost on the grill and the luscious oiliness of the fish was lost. My son ordered beef and eat everything as it was served medium so soft to eat in bite size pieces so he liked it. I am not a fan of the food and only attended on the request of my son.  Value \u2013 teppanyaki is always expensive. My young son and I had 2 mains, 1 starter and a glass of wine and it cost us \u00a390. Every time I pay the bill for a teppanyaki dinner, I vow never to come back and year after year the kids beg to come back for the show which obviously made the meal delicious to them.  Benhihana does the teppanyaki show well and kids and groups will enjoy the experience. It seems fully booked all the time so there is certainly an audience for it. But it is not good value for money, and the food is uninteresting and bland (even with their sauce options). If the kids have a great desire to go then we may consider going back, but never for any other reason."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 2.0}}]}}, {"id": "72270", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d3258396-Reviews-360_Panorama_Restaurant-Istanbul.html", "review_date": "October 8, 2020", "review_city": "Istanbul, Turkey", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Great dining with a view", "review": "I did a lot of research where to dine in Sultanahmet with a great view and finally chose this one. Now, after being there I'm positive it's the best place. Imagine dining on the terrace with Hagia Sophia just across you, at the same level, so you see its entire beauty. The restaurant is on the top floor of a building just across the famous Basilica cistern with direct views of Hagia Sophia. Although such places typically lack in service and food quality, I can assure you that service was great - very kind and fast and food was excellent.

With this background we were keen to go further and try fine dining. This restaurant was very good indeed. We chose the tasting menu for the month, in this case March, with the suggested wines. The style was Cambodian with immense care and effort taken with detail and combinations. How many different flavours may be presented without a clash? Well quite a lot! The wines from various countries were just right; for example with the, undoubtedly, free range chicken we were given a light red (Sangiovese). Later a sweet Gascon white was similarly well matched. This restaurant stands comparison with two star Michelin listed restaurants that we have been to. We were pleased to pass this opinion on to the very knowledgeable Executive Chef when she called at our table. The staff were impeccable, appropriately attentive and obliging.

So I was delighted when a friend suggested that a group of us should go to Chamisse this week. It is a very good restaurant, most of the team are Lebanese and the welcome is warm.  The setting is very simple, which is fine: the focus is always on the food. We chose to have a selection of mezzo and a selection of grills placed down the table so that the group of 20 could chat and eat contentedly without making choices. This is where Lebanese food it as its best, being shared by everybody with a little bit of this and more of that up and down the table. Small dishes flowed in (kebbeh, kellaj, fatayr, hummus, mfassack, tabbouleh, fattoush, loubieh bel zeit, labneh, moutabbel and more besides) and all tasted very good. My only comment was that some of the flavours were slightly blander than I like but they were very good. In particular the kebbeh was as good as I have tasted (deliciously moist in the middle and crunchy on the outside) and the labneh was wonderfully subtle. So definitely 4 plus for the food.

The response confirming my booking was quick and we arrived as arranged. We were allocated a nice table and enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant that is set in a nicely wooded area with atmospheric candles and lighting. Service was good and efficient, perhaps a little bit too much so. We ordered several glasses of wine before we ordered food and at 5 US dollars a glass, it was good value. My wife and I both ordered the same food, starting with a green mango and crispy fish salad, followed by Stir Fry vegetables in an Oyster sauce with rice. A pre-starter arrived which was pleasant enough. The starter was fresh, piquant and tasty. The stir fry vegetables of the main course arrived quickly after, perhaps a little too quickly, and were only luke-warm, as was the sticky rice giving me the impression it had been sat around waiting for us to finish our starter. However, it was tasty and the vegetables were a la dente as they should be. Whereas the food wasn't top notch, it was perfectly acceptable and for the price, good value when one considers that the traditional Cambodian music/dancing that takes place from 7.30pm until 8.30pm is included in the price. We both had an enjoyable evening which was perfect for our first night n Cambodia. The restaurant was almost full so created a good atmosphere.

The chicken was a little dry, but once dipped into the tartar sauce that was provided it was quite nice.

We chose the set Menu ($45 pax) and paired it with the premium wine suggestions ($29pax). Each course is presented beautifully, explained and matched with a delicious wine selection. There was no rushing to push you onto the next course which added to the calm atmosphere. The food was nothing short of excellent! We have been lucky enough to dine at some fine Michelin starred restaurants and the food here was definitely on a par and in some respects exceeded.

Our waiter started out great, but we never saw him after placing our order as he was then moved to serve a large party. Consequently we never had service again.

Burrata cheese with cherry tomato and arugula appetizer was the freshest cheese I've had a restaurant - seasoned perfectly with lovely presentation. I had the squid ink spaghetti with scampi langoustine and squash blossoms - the pasta was fresh and cooked perfectly with a velvety smooth and rich sauce. Definitely one of the best pasta dishes I've had! Dessert was very good - cannoli had perfectly crisp and flavorful shells with a delectable filling. The custard in the tiramisu and creme brulee was smooth, rich, and flavorful. I would highly recommend this restaurant - try to come early because it is cramped and when it fills up, you have no elbow room.
