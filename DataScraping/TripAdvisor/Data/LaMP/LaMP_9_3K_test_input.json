A big basket of bread and the still water I had were free of charge! For these service and this quality of food the price was fantastic! I highly recommend to everybody and I will definitely be back! They offer also a nice breakfast buffet for 30 euros per person!"

I had the spagetti Nero with Langoustines and zucchini flowers. The sauce was lacking in flavour and was very peppery. They must have run out of zucchini flowers (already at 1:30pm) because there were none. My wife had the wild boar meatballs with porcini mushrooms and truffles. Both meals were okay, but not top notch Italian/Sicilian. They have very few Sicilian wines, and a lot of Tuscan / Piedmontese, which is probably understandable in the US. Sicily does have a lot of great wine producers so perhaps they aren't available here. They did have one Planeta rose, which is good, but for a popular choice Plumbago would be good. Work needs to be done in the kitchen & on the wine list, then perhaps they will live up to the name they created."

There's a wide range of toppings, including some that you wouldn't necessarily think of. You can eat in or take away and also there's room service . We did eat out at the Blue Mango a couple of times and the experiences here were really good too. We decided to try to lamb steak at the kitchen table and were so glad we did, we enjoyed it so much we had our last holiday meal at the Kitchen Table, this time we had the pork dish, and this did not disappoint either . The kitchen table is definitely on a par with the blue mango. Poppy and the whole team are so friendly , helpful , always smiling , they are a great bunch, and an absolute credit to their employers. Thanks to all for a great stay!"

We chose the Chef's menu with all surprises and with a glass of wine to go with each plate - good choice. A lot of surprising tastes, which were very special and enjoyable. Service was very good. In any case, we promised to come back another day, which we certainly will."

Most guests take a tuktuk or hire a private van. I suggest the management should post a road sign at the corner of dela paix and taphoul street so it would be easier for people to locate it.  On the lighter note, the food was worth the trip. The beef salad and amok fish is by far the best I had tasted in Cambodia. The beef steak w/ potato was good but the beef is not tender and hard to slice (they didn't provide steak knife). The seafood w/ rice is too salty.  The server overlooked one of our orders in which we followed up after almost half hour. The manager was apologetic afterwards.  The French lady (communication manager?) approached us and all the other guests.  Overall, this trip is indeed a meal for a cause."

The amok fish and beef salad is excellent!  However, their service is a little off. They overlooked one of our orders, and we waited for almost 30 minutes for it to be served, we followed it up and it was really overlooked. the manager was apologetic but it's really no big deal.  A French lady approached us and said she's the communication manager (?) for sala bai. She asked if the food was good and to post our comments on trip advisor.  Food was good, service is 4/5. After all, this is a training school. We came here for the good food and the server still has a lot of training to go through.  A little suggestion: I hope they would put a road sign at the corner of dela paix and Phum tapoul street so tourists who prefer to walk would find it easier."

Although there was a sign at the entrance which said they were at full capacity, with a couple of recommendations of places to eat near buy (we love this \"support your neighbour concept btw\") we thought we'd try our luck anyway. Luckily, a couple was just leaving and the lovely host sat us down straight away. WILD specialises in fresh and fried spring rolls and they were delicious! We washed it down with a jug of their (just as delicious) cocktail. We recommend the TAMARA - lemongrass infused gin with pomegranite liquor, lime and ginger ale. The service was welcoming, friendly and attentive. Loved it!"

The cocktails are expensive and range between 8 to 16 uk pounds but they are well worth the price and the presentation is unique. The style of the bar and restaurant is not traditionally Moroccan but has a more trendy European city vibe. We had dinner in the restaurant and the menu choices were modern and reasonably priced- \u00a310 pounds for starters and mains between 12-18. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable but most importantly the food was delicious., beautifully presented. Overall flawless. If you are looking for something different well worth a visit."

There were more vegetarian items which pleased me because I eat more vegetarian when eating Indian. The had lamb and chicken which were both excellent. I had the lamb and my friend had the chicken.  I loved the mixed vegetables and the mushroom mattar. The chickpeas were excellent too. Like I said everything was good.  This is one of the best Indian buffets I have ever had. I would definitely go back when in NYC.  Well done!"

The food is awesome especially the mutton biryani. So tender it melts in your mouth. The mutton cutlet on a roti is also soft like butter, a must try.  All in all, a place to visit every time in DXB."

It was my daughter's 21st birthday celebrations, and I have always wanted to go to Theo's restaurant as I am a huge fan of his and Saturday Kitchen on BBC1 so always enjoy his appearances on the show. The restaurant knew it was my daughters birthday as I had informed them, but we were not expecting the fuss that was made of us. We were put on one of the chef's tables (Matt Tebutt and his wife had the other which just made my night) and Theo greeted us, wished Lily a happy birthday. He had time for everyone in the restaurant, guests were in and out of the kitchen all evening. The waitress we had was just fabulous and we had an absolutely superb evening, one we will be talking about for years to come. We had the Sicily taster menu, 5 courses with wines that accompany the courses. every course was sublime. And at \u00a350 a head, thoroughly affordable for the West End of London. Cannot wait to return, already planning my next visit. And I know I keep thanking him, but thank you Theo, and thank you to all the staff. You really have a great team"

I tried a glass of red wine which was a good house one. I also had room for the banana rolls which were lovely. The staff were attentive and so friendly. A must if you are staying in Siem Reap."

            "review": "Recently went here for a friends birthday as a large group of 12. We had been put into a private room away from the main area - which we were glad about as it was extremely loud in the main restaurant. The cocktails list is poor - most sound fairly unappetising and the only few we tried were not great & we wouldn't have ordered a 2nd. One had an ice cube in which was the size of the glass so was an utter rip off for what you receive. Once at the table, we asked for the wine list which was apparently non-existent as the waitress came back & read 7 wines from her notepad (not being able to tell us anything about any of them)! She explained they were between wine lists, however even if this is the case its fairly poor for any restaurant to not be able to manage this smoothly. We opted for the safe option of Prosecco and beers - after our 2nd bottle of Prosecco, none of the rest of the bottles were cold which the waitress seemed pretty embarrassed about. She also managed to spill half a glass over my friend when pouring it out. The food was ok, we ordered starters to share (the prawns were tasty) and each ordered a main with some vegetables to share too. At the point of mains, you are basically paying for the spectacle only as the portions are fairly small & food is fairly bland & overcooked. I had the seafood special & the salmon was the best thing since its such an oily fish it could take the extra cooking. The lobster was unfortunately a bit chewy. The egg fried rice was also very blend. Each person also got a pair of ramekins with a couple of sauces - these were not nice & didn't compliment the fish at all, one being overly mustardy - assumably to go with steak. For the entainment value, its a bit of fun with a group of friends but I wouldn't go here just for the food. It was also very expensive for what it is - our bill was over \u00a3120 per person by the end, which was without desserts & there were a few people driving. I would rather spend that sort of money knowing I'm going to get much better food & service. Unfortunately, we won't be returning and I wouldn't recommend to any food lovers thinking of going."

The hosts were so friendly and knowledgeable, especially about the wine. We tried seven different wines, and I don't mean a small taste. They really encouraged us to try different wines with different foods. The food was excellent, as was the wine. Sure it's not the typical restaurant experience, but get outside your comfort zone. It's well worth it. We enjoyed meeting the other guests, and the Owners took such great care of us. This was one of our favorite dining experiences in all of Argentina!"

Thank goodness our concierge new this place because I'm sure it is better than anything we would have chosen. Superb food,... attentive, well informed waiters and for a sunny evening the perfect conservatory style room decorated with flair. This is a fantastic find for those wanting the very best fine dining experience. It does not have a Michelin star yet but I'm convinced that it is not far away. My only negative note would be that wine by the glass seems mean even by French standards. It is a drop more than the average Australian tasting. BUT... food of this quality for $70 a head is hard to beat. Only one restaurant has come near this place in our three weeks of travel so far. Almost perfection!!"

We\u2019re a little older than their usual demographic but we didn\u2019t feel at all out of place and the food was excellent and very good value for Paris. Very casual and relaxed atmosphere and deservedly very busy though the brothers still found time to chat to us and make us feel at home. It was very interesting hearing a French prospective on the riots, which had just begun when we arrived. It seems they are as passionate about their country as they are about their food. Well worth a visit and if we ever make it back to Paris I know where I\u2019ll be eating. Thank you guys, you justly deserve your five star ratings."

            "review": "Without a doubt, the BEST meal in our 5-day trip to Siem Reap. The restaurant serves a 6-course set meal (no a la carte) and the menu changes monthly. We loved every single course, except for 1 of the main course (of pork, which was a bit dry). But every other course was amazing - full of delicious flavours, fresh ingredients and always a refreshing take on traditional Khmer cuisine, infused with modern cooking techniques. My favourite was the dessert - a fusion of western and Asian flavours - ice cream, and traditional cakes from Asia.  The restaurant is also beautifully furnished and the wait staff were attentive and responsive. At the end of our meal, one of the chefs came out to meet us and was open to our feedback about the pork course. They also gave us a box of 2 macarons each, which were really delicious (note that i'm really particular about macarons).  Overall, a most wonderful dining experience in Siem Reap."

There's a wide range of toppings, including some that you wouldn't necessarily think of. You can eat in or take away and also there's room service . We did eat out at the Blue Mango a couple of times and the experiences here were really good too. We decided to try to lamb steak at the kitchen table and were so glad we did, we enjoyed it so much we had our last holiday meal at the Kitchen Table, this time we had the pork dish, and this did not disappoint either . The kitchen table is definitely on a par with the blue mango. Poppy and the whole team are so friendly , helpful , always smiling , they are a great bunch, and an absolute credit to their employers. Thanks to all for a great stay!"

The group made up more than half the dinner guests so I think the staff was hesitant to say anything to the oblivious parents. It is an expensive and nice restaurant by Hanoi standards so I did not expect to be subject to a hour of regular high pitched screaming and much running around."

We returned two days later to try more yummy menu items and were sad to leave! Khmer Amok Vegan and Pumpkin burger were our favorites. Local ice coffee and passion fruit spritzer were divine, and served with metal straws, a small detail we appreciated. Paul and Sara were amazing hosts, one on each visit, and were willing to answer all our questions about their Swiss foundation that does amazing practical charity work, in the Swiss-German apprenticeship style. The staff were all extremely helpful and well trained (better than most service we have elsewhere!). Prices are reasonable. Location is tucked away in quiet street a ten minute walk from the Made in Cambodia market. The garden and indoor seating areas were both charming. Thanks again, Paul and Sara, and hopefully see you sooner than six years (in the same location!)."

The quality oft he food is excellent. The buffet meals at there Marriott Cafe are well worth a visit but be careful as during low season they are few and far between. They have different themes and in my experience they are all great value. Good for families and they always have child friendly dishes available."

The restaurant is small so reservations are necessary as it gets busy. The staff are friendly and welcoming and the view is lovely over the water. The menu has some Thai traditional dishes but also some not so well known ones and the Grouper with three sauces is our favourite. It comes filleted and has amazing flavours. We ate here twice and if we were here another day we would have been back for a third day. Definitely one of the highlights of staying at this hotel. Do not miss it!"

My husband is fussy about his medium rare steak and this was cooked beautifully. We also had the Aromatic chicken and the way that was presented was amazing. The bombe Alaska was pretty special not to mention deliciously decadent. A great drinks menu as well - fabulous! The wait staff were so friendly - wait staff can either make or break your meal, regardless of how good or bad the food was, and the team here were great - super helpful with the menu, happy to have a quick chat and a joke. If you want a special dining experience, put Flame on your list!"

            "review": "After a few months I have decided to repeat my visit to the Blue Wagon as I still remember their fabolous dishes. This time I went just for a quick three course business lunch menu for a very reasonable price of 178 CZK. Soup excellent, main course excellent, dessert excellent. Real value for money and highly recommended not only for dinner, but also for surprisingly delicious business lunch. I haven't had such good beef on mushrooms with sauce and dumplings for quite a long time, the meat was just melting down in mouth. And even though I am usually not raving about sweets, their dessert a brownie like cade made from rye flour was exactly as tailor made to my taste not so sweet. These guys know to do their job very well and I am sure to repeat the visit soon."

What a pleasant surprise! I had the blackened fish tacos and yummy Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough, New Zealand, and my husband had the tuna poke appetizer and a grilled chicken and mango salad. He kept commenting how unique and delicious the lemony dressing was. The salad was a large entree sized portion, which you don't always find when you order salad for lunch in Manhattan.  The decor is fun and as you'd expect if someone named Tommy Bahama lived there. The bathrooms were gorgeous, which is always a pleasant surprise in New York City restaurants.  Our server, Jared, was fabulous. Friendly, efficient, and very knowledgable about the dishes (my husband has food restrictions). He is an asset to their team!"

I arrived with others at 7.50pm checked in at the front of house and they don't me we were the first ones there and to wait in the long/bar area which we did. Ordered drinks and waited for the rest of our party to arrive. Everyone arrived but one person arrived by 8.10pm. Waiters come up and took our drinks order and we sat and waited. By 8.45pm we were wondering what was happening with the table so I asked the waitress and they said that they had given away our table as we weren't all here on time. Outraged I asked why no one had told us. Blank faced ignored the question and told me that we were all late and that's the policy. I then asked to speak to the manager who was just as clueless and rude. Not explaining why he had given away our table without informing us. Arriving early and being told to wait in the bar they knew we were waiting for the table yet still they ignored us. The manager said there's nothing he can do as there are no tables and we should wait. By 9.15pm we were still waiting and by then my party was frustrated, hungry and shocked at the service being received. No apology was given and no one seemed to care. We ended up leaving the restaurant and the whole birthday celebration was ruined. We had all travelled from out of London just to be ignored and treated like rubbish.  I would never return to this place again. Clearly it's popular because of the chefs performances when cooking the food but the service is terrible. No people skills. The manager hasn't got a clue what he is doing. Overall embarrassment."

It's over priced and I think the focus of the visit is on he chef preparing the food in front of you and not actually the quality of the food. Overpriced and my clothes smelt of food when I left the restaurant."

The staff were super accommodating and professional. It is not a classic Vietnamese restaurant - the dishes are very trendy (may i say \"hipster\"). The prices are more on the expensive side but still reasonable. If you are staying at the hotel do make sure to check out the breakfast as well - it is excellent!"

Beyond the location and the variety of breakfast options, including many vegan dishes the staff can\u2019t do enough to please and help. Putri was just stunning. So friendly caring, always with a smile and greeted us by name every day. The service has been 5 star. I warmly recommend staying at Theanna villas and enjoying this restaurant every day The highlight has been the floating breakfast this morning in our villa pool. Wow . This is a must when visiting Theanna Villas in Canguu. Thank you beautiful Putri."

Both the main course dishes were tasty, flavourful and served in an attractive clay pot. For dessert we had passion fruit ice cream which was an excellent presentation in a scooped out passion fruit. Taste too was good. We also had creme brulee which was made perfectly. An excellent meal with great ambience. Will surely recommend visiting this restaurant."

We emailed Paula when we arrived and booked in for the 2 course lunch and pool day for 290DH, included in the price are your sun loungers, towels, afternoon tea/snack and a sun hat! We also organised transfers for 150DH each way. We loved it so much, that we emailed them to book in again a few days later. However, there was a school group booking on the day we wanted so they emailed us to let us know in case we wanted to avoid that day, which goes to show, they wanted us to have a nice relaxing day and not just take our money for a day at the pool - well done!  The food was absolutely delicious and a good portion size. The service was excellent albeit we had to wait a long time for dessert, which was worth the wait!  The infinity pool is huge and very clean, although not heated, which is a great cool down in the heat. MLT really is a beautiful, clean, friendly place to have a chilled day at the pool, if we return to Marrakech we would consider staying here. Highly recommended.  Make sure you book in advance and I would recommend booking the return transfer service for 150DH each way."

I was greeted and wished happy birthday taken to my table which was adorned with red rose petals ! I was left to digest menu and people watch as the restaurant became very busy.Service is slick,efficient and done with a minimum of fuss. I order pate and fish both dishes delicious and fish just melted in my mouth.I was suggested a lovely riesling by the sommelier and it was a perfect match. I am left to enjoy my meal and plates cleared in an instant.Order a beautiful sorbet for desert and much to my surprise the staff assemble and sing happy birthday to me followed by applause from diners which was a lovely touch. This is fine dining Bistro style but a delightful experience and highly recommended!"

The incredible hard working staff served a shrimp/ calamari appetizer after a small plate of mint flavored tzatziki and pita. Main courses were sea bream and John Dory, both of which were flavored in a very different but delicious way. This food according to the waiter has Moroccan, Lebanese and Turkish influences. The Sauvignon Blanc was excellent. I\u2019d take off half a star for the temperature of the food (not quite hot enough for me) but overall a wonderful dinner and would eat there again.

Boy am I glad we did because we saw about 10 couples get turned down for not having one. Almost every table was marked \"reserved\" when we arrived at opening.  There is a good reason for the reservations because the food is so delicious, so flavorful, and home cooked right behind the counter by the husband of the husband/wife team. The wife serves the food and takes the orders and she is SO friendly (unless you dont have a reservation).  They have a good wine selection and the menu is significantly large. I was feeling a little under the weather when we got there so I got a soup - oh my gosh - it was just a simple mushroom soup but we soaked up every last drop with the bread and she came over and hugged us because she saw me soaking up the last bit of liquid and laughed at us. But it was that good. We also got the tomato balls, a must for being in Greece, and they were served with tzatziki, SO GOOD. My husband complimented that for a fried food it was so light. We also got the beer chicken and a seabass - both were amazing, we finished basically everything. They also give a complimentary dessert (assuming they rotate). Ours was some phyllo dough with some cream maybe (not really sure) but so good. The wife also takes a picture of every table and puts it on her facebook site, which I think is pretty cool.  We wanted to go back a second time in our 3 dinners we had in Santorini, but then figured we should try something else....regreted not going back. Absolute must - please go you will not be disappointed."

Suggest making a reservation in advance, as it seems pretty popular. Just FYI the restaurant looks like it is in a residential area, depending on where you come from. But it is with a cluster of some other restaurants. Indoor/outdoor dining options.  The pasta is homemade and super fresh, almost as good as when we were in Italy. Great wine/drink list, and reasonable prices for what you get. Good selection of appetizers, and had very friendly service. They offer complimentary limoncello after dinner. The bathrooms were also very clean.  We ended up also having this as our last dinner, since it was so good. Lots of options for both meat eaters, and vegetarians. The appetizers are a very good size, and so were the pasta portions.  My husband had the linguine with prawns the first night, and said it was one of the best he has had. He also said the same about the Amatriciana (wasn't super spicy). I got the rag\u00f9 the first night, which was excellent, and the macaroni with the asparagus & pancetta the 2nd night, which was super light and full of flavor."

We had the three course fixed price lunch which came with a glass of fizz but with the option of choosing dishes from the a la Carte menu. The food was a real delight - creative food imaginatively presented and cooked to perfection; coupled with excellent suggestions from the sommelier. Everything was perfect and the service faultless - wonderfully attentive, engaging but not intrusive. This was an amazing dining experience and one we will undoubtedly be repeating - soon."

                        "review": "This is a stunning and very romantic restaurant housed within a jewel-like riad which is tucked away down a narrow alleyway in the heart of the medina. Tables are situated around a pool and a central marble courtyard with a mosaic clad fountain. A large speaker provides some cool background beats. The restaurant offers two menus \u2013 Moroccan and Italian \u2013 with the ability to mix and match both. The latter offered a welcome break from the traditional tagines. The king prawns with diced tomatoes and cocktail sauce and the eggplant mozzarella for starters were both beautifully seasoned and bursting with flavour and the home made fettucine and tortellini parmesan cream for main brought back fond memories of some of the best Italian pasta houses. There is an extensive wine list although the Moroccan wine is slightly on the expensive side. The only downside was the service which can best be described as unfriendly and unengaging and we felt a little rushed with courses arriving quickly when we had indicated we would like a break or, in the case of the bill, unprompted. It was slightly odd to be taken to a back room to pay the bill by credit card but I had nothing to fear in that all of the staff were extremely courteous and polite. This was our stand out favourite restaurant during our nine night stay in Marrakesh and we cannot wait to return.  Tip: Ignore the young men waiting to greet you when you leave the restaurant who will seek to persuade you to follow them on a different route back to the main square on the basis that the conventional route is closed at night. This is a standard ruse at this (and many other) locations and an attempt to fleece you of your hard earned dirhams\u2026\u2026"

The hostess was very friendly and helped our waiter, who sometimes, appeared to disappear or maybe he had too many tables. The Bread that they served was warm and delish. We had an appetizer of the Caprese which was ok BUT needs more flavor....The absolute STAR of the meal was the mushroom risotto, it was OUT OF THIS WORLD amazing, seasoned wonderfully - portions HUGE - one of the best meals I have had in a long time!! I will be back to try the desserts and other menu options soon!"

What I was served was a cold glass of wine. It either not what he showed me or an opened bottle that was in The fridge. Somewhat disappointing. The satay presentation was good - but the chicken was chewy and lacked a proper seasoning. The service was very good."

A very polite man in a panama hat( on the main street) takes you through reception to the lift. Views are 360 degrees, Europe, Asia all the key sights, inside and outside seating.  Beers reasonable for location, we had a selection of starters, mezze was our favourite along with what i think was call a village horn.  Only other English people we came across in our 4 day trip sat on the terrace behind us.......non other than Charlie Ross, off the BBC. Obviously being English we feigned indifference and allowed him to enjoy his meal in private."

The first night I opted for the Italian menu, after travelling in Morocco for a week during the height of summer and in in the midst of Ramadan, good Italian food was such a welcome change. The second time I was there i chose beef tagine, it was, dare i say, one of the best tagine meal i had.  The setting was beautiful, in the middle of the Riad, you can choose to eat indoor or eating alfresco by the pool. The service was friendly and attentive. Recommended."

While this restaurant has prices that might be slightly higher than some other Italian restaurants here, the food is fabulous and it was one of the best meals I have had so far on this trip (I've been in Budapest, Vienna and now Prague). I ordered the meat ravioli in tomato sauce. It was very good, obviously homemade, and presented perfectly. Then, there was the pistachio semifreddo which was so yummy it makes you want to lick the plate! Our waiter (George) was attentive, friendly and so pleasant to chat with. We ate inside as the evening was a bit cool and seeing the light play off the Bohemian crystal chandeliers in the dining room was lovely. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a non-touristy place to eat which has a great menu selection. We are definitely going to go back before we leave Prague."

Located in a \u201csexy massage\u201d district old, almost dilapidated place that had not seen repairs for years. Waiters are disorganized and do not remember who ordered what and are slow. Our guy cracked a neck or the beer bottle with opener and still offered it to us and said he will bring a glass. He hesitated to replace the beer. Most importantly - food and drinks. If you order a gin and tonic and they have one type of gin only a place cannot be rated #1 in Hanoi (maybe 1001). My drink was horrible. Mushroom soup was edible. Fried squid had little squid in it. Mostly breading. Very limited menu for #1 place overall. We tried a lot better food here. So far I am very disappointed in Vietnamese cuisine - the menu is the same everywhere - pho or bahn me (sub sandwich)."

Beer, good tap beers, was shame no Pilsner but the pale ale was good  3. View.....outside, by the lake, can\u2019t buy that view  4. Playlist... if you are a 50 something the songs all took us back to our mis-spent 20\u2019s  5. Callum.....our waiter....what a legend. Friendly, funny, entertaining, helped us around the menu, made our evening memorable! Restaurants need more Callum\u2019s !!  Highly recommended!!"

Guests are quickly ushered in and up an equally unimpressive concrete staircase, into the dining area. Guests (all tourists from across the globe) meet and mingle over champagne and canap\u00e9s before being introduced to the wonderful array of fresh meats that will be served later on. Seated around a long, wooden table, diners quickly find that, apart from the food, this is a very social experience and conversations soon develop, whilst course after course of the finest meats, salad and finally dessert are served, each paired with an excellent wine. Pricey, a bit touristy, but, over all, a great experience."

On entering the restaurant I had no idea what was behind the facade, which looks pretty ordinary, and said I wanted to eat inside. The waiter politely sugggested outside would be better and led me around the side of the building. I was really amazed, they have unique swing-mattress, bed like tables (though you can choose a normal table if you want) that make you feel like it is a high end restaurant in Marrakech (the last time I saw anything like this). So we were super comfortable and our toddler was in her element. The food was also great, the drinks wonderful and the prices, even with the 10% added at the end, crazy low given the ambience and environment. We will be back!"

The chef was super nice and when i wanted to know the name of and ingredient he tipped for me in my phone.  we tried to come back before leaving paris and it wasn't posible fully booked for the week so this restaurant is a new reason to comeback in 2018. i hope this restaurant continues to evolve and gain the recognition it deserves i can see a michelin star approaching"

A hospitality old timer, the little Siem Reap Sala Bai Hotel School has captured my heart & soul through its commitment, tuition quality, consistency, humanity and performance. Check their website as SB closes 2-3 months in summer before greeting new students. Returning as often as possible I know them now a bit. The lunch (part of practical training) is always good and of very good value and quality. Choice of well composed Khmer or Western light set menus; I have never been disappointed. The fully inexperienced Khmer youngsters come straight from the absolutely most disfavored rural communities and show extraordinary will and pride in learning. You'd be amazed at what they can perform after a couple of initial training months - starting from literally nothing at all in terms of hospitality & what foreign or Local guests might expect. Photos from I accompanied SB social worker on very! rural field family visits. I congratulate all active and involved. And I recommend you to book a little ahead. Enjoy!"

What a job the Team does... the lunch menu was exciting and came out just excellent - this at a very very fair cost. The juices and shakes are fresh, yummy and super well made, the service flawless and the greeting is the warmest. I rounded up with a very good and relaxing massage. The treatment rooms are large, clean and have nothing to envy the large fine hotel spas (I know them as well!).  When in Siem Reap, don't miss the chance to come and support a fantastic vocational hospitality school for underprivileged local youth. Bravo Sala Bai!"

The welcome, the sweet attentive service supervised by pro teachers and the quality of the food served are impressive, even more so considering both kitchen and service is manned by young students. This small school is impressively committed to fighting poverty and human trafficking via vocational training. Sala Bai enrolls only the most disfavored Cambodian youths and provides a year long hospitality training (plus housing, food, clothing, health care etc) absolutely free of charge. All students (70% young ladies, the most exposed) are then employed by upscale hotels in Siem Reap. This has broken the evil circle of poverty for now thousands of families. I lift my hat to this achievement and encourage you to book a lunch! Thank you."

Mixing creative flavors and proteins (venison, pheasant, octopus) with more traditional Czech fare yields a menu that is fun, challenging and changes frequently. It was so good we ate there on consecutive nights. Each time I had the venison, which is easy to \"get wrong\" -- but it was perfect in seasoning, sauce, cooking temperature and a duet of thin-sliced asparagus and polenta cakes. The plate presentation is as good as any New York high end restaurant - but expect to spend about 1/4 of what you would in the Big Apple. The best leading indicator is the wine list -- carefully curated and personally selected, and priced for you to enjoy a variety of pairings, not make you feel guilty about venturing into new areas. The wait staff knows the wines (including obscure Italian vintages) and was perfectly attentive. Possibly the best meal I have eaten in Europe."

The places ambiance was nice and much better then what i had come to expect from similar Indian joints in the same locality. Also it was packed , we got luck with a table and the service was still very good - the waiter helped with the selection and our dishes were served promptly.  I ordered a Murgh Hyderbadi Biryani for myself . My two friends being vegetarian's ordered a Subzi Masala Biryani. The Food were served in clay pot with a nan covering the top . Great presentation. The food tasted Yum but a bit too spicy - we did ask for mild spicy dishes. One of the first time i enjoyed a Biryani. The quantity's are huge and one dish is enough for at-lest two people.  From what i saw of other tables people were ordering all sorts of dishes and enjoying them. Will like to try out other stuff when i am next time over to."

If you are looking for a quiet, say romantic setting this is not it. However the intimacy adds to the experience."

Also the service is outstanding, nothing spared yet is not over the top. Would highly recommend this establishment. Also $70 for 3 courses of this quality is very good compared to some other similar offerings in the city."

We had only experienced them for afternoon tea before, so perusing their \"all day dining\" menu was a little different.  They have a good selection of salads and sandwiches, which can be augmented with a good selection of wines and champagnes.  Food is a subset of that on offer from the JW Steakhouse (also in the hotel), but served in the opulent style of the Park Room.  If you're looking for something slightly less than afternoon tea, this is an option. (Although afternoon tea at the Park Room is also excellent.)"

Mia who served me was so attentive and taught me how to prepare my main course of Grilled 'Lang' fish (number 11).  The interior of the restaurant was delicately decorated and it was a peaceful experience from starter to finishing dinner with a ginger and orange tea.  It was a shame this was my final night in Hanoi but when it comes to eating, I saved the best until last."

Rennaud clearly explained their menu and you could see the passion and love put into each item. It\u2019s a great set up- there are lots of options, you can get fresh or fried. Be sure to order the beef and carmelized onion (drool worthy) and the taco one as well! Both had fabulous flavours and weren\u2019t overly greasy or doughy. The fresh roll we opted for were mama Mia and the Greek getaway. Again both were fantastic- my husband said he\u2019d return to Cambodia just to come back to Wild- that says something! Lastly, the hubby had the chocolate spring rolls. He said they were a grea treat. Take lorraines advice on how to eat them- they\u2019re messy!! In addition to the fabulous food, we paired it with a jug of the refreshing Tamara beverage. One word...YUM! Beyond the food, the service was perfect- staff were very knowledgeable and the venue itself had a great ambiance. We loved the relaxed feel with the tropical vibe. Would return again!"

We've treated ourselves to a number of top end meals in the UK and abroad, this year, and this was definitely up there as one of the best. On a par with some multi Michelin starred restaurants. So pleased that we visited, mainly based on having a table available and good reviews. Hope to return."

I\u2019m not a particular lover of Indian food as I do not like spicy meals but this restaurant exceeds its self with a wide variety of choices to meet everyone\u2019s palate. I started with an excellent prawn dish and then had the butter chicken curry both of which were superb and well worth a visit.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that is nearby I would add that the staff were extremely pleasant and very helpful. He will not be disappointed."

We got here around 45minutes early, so we had some drinks from the bar and sat in the seating area until we were called. When our table was ready, we went to be seated. As usual the chefs were very entertaining, making us laugh and really interacting with us which was great! We had the set dinner menu, one was the salmon for approx \u00a329.50 & the other was the chicken for approx \u00a324.00. Both came with onion soup as a starter, a prawn selection, a bowl of white rice & some salad. The best part about the meal was watching the Teppanyaki style cooking right in front of you. We didn\u2019t have dessert because we had no space for it but we did have 4 cocktails throughout. The bill came to \u00a391 including the 12.5% discretionary tip. Oh and if it\u2019s a birthday celebration or special occasion, let them know so they can put the personalised message on the big screen for you in the lounge areas! It\u2019s always a nice surprise"

Friendly staff and nice ambience. The main dishes come complete with rice. We had spring rolls, claypot pork belly, mango salad, duck, etc. The dishes were generally above average (6.5/10) except for the duck meat (4.5/10) as its meat was tougher than we thought. Prices are reasonable too. Finding the restaurant may be challenging too as it is located in a tiny side cul-de-sac."

            "review": "This is a very pretty restaurant on the beachfront at the Anantara hotel. The location and set up is very nice, and having a meal beside the beach with the crashing waves in the background is very romantic and soaking with atmosphere and style.  Service: The service was exemplary as expected at an Anantara. Attentive, helpful, and unobtrusive. They were kind enough to help move us inside to the air conditioned space which helped when it became too hot. They explained much of the dishes to us as well which was nice. When we left they got us a buggy to the reception and called our hotel and asked them to send a buggy to collect us. We were very impressed and pleased with this.  Food: The menu is very limited with only a few options for starters, mains and desserts. I was hoping for more seafood dishes and options. Their hallmark dish was seafood cooked on top of salt bricks. Heating the bricks and cooking it on top allows the seafood to absorb some of the flavour of the exotic salts. It felt gimmicky and I could not really taste any great benefit. I ordered the prawn version and it tasted like regular grilled prawns and was nothing special. I hoped to have some of the famous Thai flavours and passion reflected in the food. But I found the meal a bit bland. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the food was fresh and all was very well executed but the mains were really not that interesting. The salt sommelier was there to assist with different types of salt to enhance your meal. I am a fan of interesting salts but again, this felt a bit forced. I could barely tell the difference between the salts and quite frankly, didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to really good, tasty seafood. The starters were very good \u2013 most especially the rocket and pear salad which was quite WOW but a very small portion. The desserts were nicely made but nothing extraordinary. There was also a seafood feast but for the price, did not seem well worth it.  Price: This place was very expensive. I dont normally mind paying for good food but this felt unnecessarily expensive for what it was. I love Ananatra as a hotel and frequently dine at their restaurants even when I am not staying with them but the pricing of the is menu felt much too expensive for the food you were getting. Even if the price were lower, I would not be keen to come back again as I don\u2019t find the food (except the salad) worth the inflated cost. It is a rarity that I do not like an Anantara establishment but the balance of value for money for atmosphere \u2013 made me feel disappointed.  I would not go back again for dinner as nothing interested my taste buds. I would not mind to have a drink or light snack there but as a dinner, I felt I could get better food, variety and price at one of the other dining options on the hotel property."

                        "review": "I have never been much of a fan of teppanaki food for the taste as it is inevitably bland and boring. Benihana is a legend in the teppanyaki cuisine and for what it is, it\u2019s fine. This is a place for food theatre where people go with their kids / friends for a fun evening.  Service \u2013 the service is good at this Benihana. The reception was nice and efficient and the waitresses are nice, drinks and non-teppanaki items served quickly and they did a good job with special requests on the table. Chefs were fun, engaged the kids and put on a good show for everyone.  Food \u2013 Ordered the cod with miso and a side of scallops. The fish was good enough, but the miso was added as a sauce (vs glazed on top) which was disappointing. The unique black cod taste was lost on the grill and the luscious oiliness of the fish was lost. My son ordered beef and eat everything as it was served medium so soft to eat in bite size pieces so he liked it. I am not a fan of the food and only attended on the request of my son.  Value \u2013 teppanyaki is always expensive. My young son and I had 2 mains, 1 starter and a glass of wine and it cost us \u00a390. Every time I pay the bill for a teppanyaki dinner, I vow never to come back and year after year the kids beg to come back for the show which obviously made the meal delicious to them.  Benhihana does the teppanyaki show well and kids and groups will enjoy the experience. It seems fully booked all the time so there is certainly an audience for it. But it is not good value for money, and the food is uninteresting and bland (even with their sauce options). If the kids have a great desire to go then we may consider going back, but never for any other reason."

            "review": "Out of our 5 days we spent in Paris, this was the best meal/experience we had by far. It was such a great find by my boyfriend, who wanted to take me somewhere special for my birthday on January 4th and had booked it from trawling through TripAdvisor, not that he had to trawl far. This little restaurant is so quaint and delightful, it has so much charm, from the place itself to the waitresses and chef who all severed us at one point. A little music (or a tad louder) would have only added to the lovely ambiance. To start we had a gin cocktail as an aperitif whilst we perused over the wine menu. We were then given cured meat, bread and home made butter - this butter was to die for. We selected a bottle of wine (all great prices compared to other restaurants) and soon after our dishes began arriving one by one. I can't actually remember what was in every single one but I do know they were all delicious! The octopus was so tender, the fish lovely and light, the beef was so flavoursome, the little onion thing was amazingly tasty (how did you make an onion taste like that?), the dessert was nice but I would have preferred something a little lighter. I did get a candle in my dessert which was really sweet, my boyfriend couldn't remember mentioning that is was my birthday. We thoroughly enjoyed every last bite. The waitress was so lovely and friendly, we also figured out it was the chef who served us also which we loved. You could see their passion for food when they served us each dish and told us all the components.  I love tasting menus, they are my favourite, especially surprise ones! You are always watching and listening to see what the person opposite you is getting so you know what to expect. This is also amazingly great value for money, at only 49 euros each. Leave about 2-2.5 hours to enjoy the experience. An absolute dream, thank you so much Aspic for the best birthday! We went on to the Moulin Rouge afterwards, which is only 5 minutes away in a taxi."

The steak is incredible - this coming from someone who usually avoids steak (and beef in general), but the starter of cockles in garlicky broth was - if anything - even better.  They were a bit shorts on waiters, but the ones they had were great, and we got good advice on the wine selection too."

Dessert was blood orange pavlova with meringue & cream and sorbet. Wine was available both by bottle or glass. We paired the main with a C\u00f4te de Rh\u00f4ne, 100% syrah.

It turned out that he immigrated many years ago from Ukraine/Russia who initially studied something else but finally fulfilled his dream and opened a restaurant in Buenos Aires. The service and attitude couldn\u2019t have been friendlier and more natural. We both decided to habe beef (of course) with grilled vegetables and papas fritas with garlic. The food was served fast and smoothly and it was just perfect. Altogether a great, high quality but also unpretentious dining experience for a very reasonable price."

            "review": "We stayed at the Park Hyatt for 3 nights during our trip to France. My birthday happened to fall during our stay and we tried to get a table online but the restaurant was showing as fully booked. We emailed the hotel and they were able to confirm a reservation for us just a few nights before. Imagine our surprise when we showed up for dinner and the wonderful maitre d' escorted us to the Chef's table! We did the 7 course tasting with wine pairing but we couldn't keep track of what number we were on, very quickly. (There were so many extras!) I have some dietary limitations which the chef was able to work around, seemingly easily. With the entire kitchen on show, it was a delightful experience though very intimate at the chef's table. We were already impressed and pleased with every course that came out but when the Wagyu beef course came out- I may have cried some tears of joy because it was perfection in my mouth. I even halted the chef to tell him how amazing it was in the middle of the course. Every pairing was a classic match to the dominant flavors of each dish. The cheese course was just ridiculous. In the sheer quantity and selection. Delicious but that quantity is rough on the stomach of non French diners. The madelines and after dinner pastry they offered to pack up to have the next morning (we were so full!) and we were thankful we did!!! Those madelines were better than any other madeline I had ever had and that snail shell was perfectly executed laminated dough.  We are no strangers to multi course fine dining in NYC. This is the classic French dining experience and this was executed perfectly."

            "review": "I had bought a three course lunch here as part of a Virgin Experience Voucher for my mum's Christmas present, and wanted to give a 5-star review as it was a really fabulous afternoon. The service was thoughtful and attentive and Francesco was a lovely waiter. I loved the special touches to the experience- the complimentary bread and butter, mini tacos and fudge were all delicious and an unexpectedly kind touch which I didn't expect given that we were paying with a voucher. Plus these extras helped to keep me full for the whole day! The chequerboard menu was fun and I was delighted with my food (as was my mother). I'd really recommend the celeriac starter - a delicious salty sweetness to it. And the carrot cake was soo good. Beautifully presented food and the perfect portion size for a lunch. I have eaten in quite a few 'fine dining' restaurants and Launceston Place stood out for me as an absolutely wonderful experience and excellent food. Plus, my mum, who has never eaten out somewhere like this, had her mind blown by it haha. We will be back!"

Dinner for 3 was about $200 for 2 mains, three appetizers, 6 drinks, one dessert. Rodrigo did a marvelous job waiting on us. We will be back if we are ever here again. In warm weather there is outside dining in the shadow of the Charles Bridge. Here are the items we really liked: scallops, celery cream soup, goat cheese salad, filet schnitzel (sounds odd but great) and cream puff. Full bar with all the usual mixed drinks. Very pleasant setting with just enough ambient noise to allow a normal conversation. Reservation needed if you want a preferential seating location."

We were back every night to try a different meal to find our favourite dishes. The food was so delicious and tasty. They come out small but were so filling. Also the steak was well cooked and prepared. A huge thank you to the staff and for going above and beyond for each guest. Never a dry glass, that being water or alcohol. It was so hot one night and the inside area was fully booked so we had to sit outside. My hubby was so hot and struggling that they brought out a portable air conditioning unit for him to cool down. Now that is service - never had that type of service before."

It was nice and gave us a Prague Christmas spirit.  For starter I choosed the cheeseplatter which had some really high quality cheeses. I then had seafood and garlic bread which tasted heavenly. My husband enjoyed his meal to with veal. We had dessert and a glass of limoncello on behalf of the kitchen, a nice touch.  We had the wine on recomendation and it surely worked well with our menu.  The service was great, very friendly and welcoming. We will absolutely come back next time we are in Prague."

We're hard to please, after having some incredible ramens around the world. Although this shop makes primarily beef-based broths, they also have chicken broths, which we prefer.  They have a good Sake menu too, and a bar dedicated to this wonderful spirit.  They have bench seating, so be prepared to share your table."

The meal is done as a set menu - everyone gets the same dinner (excepting allergies). So it makes it simple, with no choices to make. The toughest decision is whether to have the wine pairing (4 glasses), or not. Have it.  The 7-course meal is presented slowly, and beautifully. It takes about 2 to 3 hours to get though dinner, and each course is fairly small. So although it may sound like 7 dishes is a lot, it feels perfect.  The restaurant, operated by the Kimsan Twins (I don't think they are actually twins), is entirely staffed by women. The kitchen, clearly visible from the first floor dining room, shows the skilled chefs at work, and provides a show to watch between courses.  The set menu changes seasonally, but I suspect that every season is a winner.  Eat here."

            "review": "My fiance and I had lunch here on a Tuesday afternoon in May at the suggestion of our the congenial general manager at Heritage Suites. We were delighted to took his suggestion. We relaxed and lounged over a 75 minute multi-course lunch which amounted to $7 per person if I remember correctly. The food was excellent, the crowd pleasant, the service attentive, and the atmosphere simple yet cute. A summary of our experience is bulleted below:  KEY COMMENTS  - Excellent food!  - Market pricing relative to other comparable options (although I think it's a better deal when you figure in the large size of the set lunch compared to other lunch options out there)  - Attentive service. Look is we had spent $50 per head and a uber fancy restaurant then my opinion in this case would be different. But the students were extremely attentive (albeit a bit inexperienced as you should fully expect).  - Cute yet very simple restaurant that is part patio and part open air inside of house. All ground floor. Very simple yet cute. It was a little warm but that was to be expected on a hot humid day in May.  - Largely an expat crowd which was amiable and appeared to be regulars for the most part. I really like places that are heavily frequented by regulars. And Sala Bai is definately enjoying support from the local expat crowd which is a both necessary and great.  - Great cause. I love love love what this restaurant and training school is doing. There are some other good ones in town but this one has a very boutique and personal touch to it!"

Like may other Siem Reap establishment, this restaurant is already ahead of the game when it comes to ban the use of plastic straws (lemongrass straws are used instead!). The food was good, not the best I had in town but definitely good for a pleasant dinner in a wonderful environment."

            "review": "We visited this restaurant during a recent city break because it was situated a few metres from our hotel. We were seated promptly and our order taken quickly. We opted for fish soup for starters. This was delicious, worth the visit alone. For main course we settled for grilled sea bass. The fillets were displayed conveniently in a cabinet in front of our table. The kitchen area was beside this and we were able to see our fish being cooked. The fillets were placed on the counter and calls for the waiting staff were made, but it took about 5 minutes from then for the plates to be delivered. The fish was nice in spite of this. In hindsight we probably should have served ourselves. Our desert was pistachio ice cream which was delicious. With wine and beer the bill came to a reasonable \u00a347.00. Overall service was a bit slow after a good start."

            "review": "Visited this restaurant for our last night in NYC (it was a Monday) having read the reviews and expecting the very best Italian food.  Can\u2019t help feeling a bit disappointed with our experience to be perfectly honest because it really didn\u2019t live up to the reviews and I think maybe we were really unlucky.  We had made a reservation and when we turned up at the restaurant there was a couple just in front of us who had arrived without a reservation. Without asking us first, the guy on the door showed them straight to a table and when he then came back to welcome us, we then had to wait for about 10 minutes while he found a table (clearly he hadn\u2019t checked the reservations before seating the other couple and/or had given our table away).  No apology, pretty inattentive service - having experienced amazing customer service in NYC, this guy definitely wasn\u2019t someone I\u2019d have put in charge of arrivals!  When we were seated, there was barely any room at the tiny tables. The restaurant was very busy so consequently it was incredibly noisy and while I know this contributes to atmosphere, it was impossible to have a quiet conversation (not least because the other tables were so so close!).  Food was good, but honestly I wasn\u2019t blown away - I\u2019ve definitely had better Italian food elsewhere in NYC and in Glasgow and London.  We had the duetto bruschetta to start with burrata, porcini and truffle and guacamole and lobster. It was nice, although the truffle was overpowering and I personally am not particularly convinced by the pairing of guacamole and lobster.  Then we had the Bucantini cacio e pepe with truffle and a special ravioli dish with seafood sauce and mussels.  Cacio e Pepe is my all time favourite Italian dish. I\u2019m afraid I wasn\u2019t blown away by this one. The pasta was a little more than al dente and the truffle sauce overpowered the simple cacio e pepe sauce too much.  The ravioli was filled with spinach and ricotta accompanying a very rich seafood sauce, it was nice but again a little heavy.  We had a very nice bottle of Primitivo, that was probably the highlight.  Generally the service wasn\u2019t great - probably because it was so busy, but still. Twice in the hour we were there birthdays were announced with music so loud it could burst your ear drums - a tradition I don\u2019t mind so much because it\u2019s nice to make a fuss of someone on their bday but the music went on for so long, long after people had lost interest!  I don\u2019t like writing negative reviews because it is so difficult running and maintaining restaurants profitably and so all the positives should be celebrated. But this place is so highly rated I just wanted to provide some balance for travellers particularly because this wasn\u2019t the outstanding quiet dinner I was expecting."

The menu changes regularly so any particular dishes may not be available. But it's part of the fun that you're not sure what you're going to get until you arrive. They were very accommodating about my scallop allergy and my partner's pescatarianism. Wherever you're from, I don't think you'd ever get a dinner and service of this quality for anything close to this price. A must do in Siem Reap."

We were shown directly to our table in a strategic corner so we could see the entire place and everything everyone ordered. Everything was delicious and well-presented on the plate. The service really stood out, friendly without being cloying. The eclectic design of the room lends an informal atmosphere that makes for a comfortable dinner. Exhausted from our overnight trip, we opted for an early evening and the owner seemed concerned we had not thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Au P\u2019tit Curieux, but we had. It was a wonderful neighborhood spot with a real flair for entertaining."

I proudly presented my findings to my travel mates and they also jumped on the bandwagon. We had dinner there almost every night we spent in Siem Reap, tried almost everything from the menu and all dishes turned out to be amazing.  I would return to Sambo without hesitation once I am back to Siem Reap.  the 8.20pm group from table 10. :) "

We got there about 7pm and were told by members of the queue that they were told they were the last to be served. Being British we ignored the warnings and joined the queues. Luckily they managed to squeeze us in and we had the best meal we had eaten in our two week trip. It was amazing value and we paid a chunk more than the bill came to as we felt that it was worth it. We even brought a few drinks to take back to the hotel with us. The spring rolls are fantastic. Also they were great for vegetarians as my husband is one. Just wished we had discovered this place on night one in Siem Reap as we'd have been back every night. Thank you to the staff and cooks at Tevy's Place."

Expensive by Balinese standards but outstanding in every way. Outstanding kitchen, service, management, ambiance and set up. Service was top notch and dessert were large but first class as well. Overall an outstanding experience and a new experience for us after may visits to Bali. If you can afford at least $100AUD a head to get the best steak ever, it\u2019s worth the effort. Highly recommend."

The wine I chose wasn't to my liking so the staff kindly swapped it over for me, no dramas at all. Such a great asset to the restaurant to have such understanding, helpful staff. They don't have a kids menu and sides are extra so it can get quite expensive. Food is excellent, full of flavour and really delicious. One of our sides was some chips and found the serving quite small however everything was very tasty and the service was great so I would recommend."

After walking around a bit, we stumbled on this place and I am sure happy we did! The place is small so be warned. We sat at a table at the back of the restaurant which is ok since a few other places we went to had an hour wait. This was a Friday night so you can imagine the neighborhood was bustling at 10:30. We ordered the 18\u201d rustica pizza which was absolutely delicious. It\u2019s a thin crust brick oven pizza that had fresh mozzarella, peppers, basil, and sausage. I definitely recommend this place for their pizza. I would come back another time to try their other dishes since their pasta dishes smelled & looked good at the tables around us."

We arrived just at sunset and should have arrived a bit earlier for full sunset viewing. Little blinky lights and folks welcoming us at the front door...only a foreshadowing to the wonderful evening in store. The deck was wonderful and we were given a seat at the edge for a great view. We ordered a bottle of nice wine and soup for a starter. We shared three dishes...pork curry, sunflower sprouts (awesome if you haven't tried in Thailand yet!), and fried prawns with black pepper. Everything was well spiced. Dishes were smaller than almost any other Thai place we've eaten, but that left room for dessert. We chose three classics and shared mango with sticky rice, a flan-like dish, and fried bananas with ice cream. All was excellent. Live music was most enjoyable and we watched families and couples if all ages enjoying themselves! We didn't want to leave! Heartily recommend. Our bill was about 2500 baht and the wine was about half of the bill."

Easy to find and an unusual set up in that the main restaurant and kitchen is adjacent each other ie another smaller quieter dining room which is accessible by going next door by exiting the restaurant and going in another doorway. Staff very accommodating and offer quiet dining ( next door) or in the main dining area which has a long table down one side seating large groups of probably 20 or more. Lovely atmosphere, can get loud and busy - basically typically Taverna. Great choice of food which is worth the wait as it\u2019s served piping hot, freshly cooked and the staff whilst attentive do not rush you through courses. It\u2019s possibly a little tired decoration wise, maybe even a few stains on the wall paper and some torn edges but if your happy with rustic environments and top quality food and service then this is the place for you. Good to see good choice of GF food and we overheard several times presumably the owner say to people \u201cforget about the menu tell me what you like, or don\u2019t like and I will sort it for you - I want you all to be happy\u2019 Amazing - how many times do you hear that in a restaurant! It was a first time visit, definitely a place we would search out again should we return to Camden"

The restaurant is above the store so i'm sure many folks have missed it. The best Key Lime martini ever....... I felt like i was in the Keys! hostess and bartender were the best! Let us plug our dying phones in behind the bar and even found a IPhone 6 charger for one of us! We will most certainly be back!!!"

The bill came to about US$ 90 per head. The staff asked as we sat down if we had any food no-nos and, once explained, all the courses were adjusted accordingly with no fuss. Needless to say, each course was imaginatively presented and contained an unusual mixture of sumptuous flavours. Each time our wine glasses were empty, they were refilled without our needing to ask. We at at Baqueano's the following evening and neither of the aforementioned was the case. The wines were superb, especially the Susana Balbo White Blend. We can't wait for our next trip to Buenos Aires to visit again."

As we approached the restaurant my lovely wife noted that it looked somewhat intimate and quaint. Apparently we thought the bar area was the restaurant, and were soon escorted up to the spacious dining room. We were seated at a window and offered menus. The service was great, but the food fell short of expectations, and was very pricey. Our neighbor makes samosas and shares them with the neighborhood, and we expected the same authenticity at Ustav. Unfortunately, the flavors and textures were not there. I ordered the butternut squash soup, which was delicious, but the chicken tikka masala did nothing for me, nor did the kulfi, which I found to be almost too frozen to cut into and more a savory dish than a dessert. The prices were quite high and we did not leave with a good taste in our mouths, literally and figuratively. Next time we will try one of the smaller (and hopefully less expensive) restaurants."

The 2nd visit was even worse. We had to ask for it to be turned down a couple of times. Unless it's to see the live jazz performances here, no one goes to a restaurant for the music. People go to chat over a meal, not scream across 2 feet of table until they're hoarse and just give up! The food was averagely OK. They wont get a 3rd chance."

Interesting combinations of tastes and preparation styles. I decided to go with beef broth and flank steak. Food presentation was modern and classic at the same time (this way I like it the most).The only reason why I\u2019m not giving 5* is that on my taste there was too much marinade on the meat and therefore the taste of it overcomes the pure taste of the flank steak. Another thing was that I ordered this steak with green beans made on bacon and some of them were still ice-cold, but this is a common mistake and it did\u2019t destroy the whole experience. I would truly recommend anyone to come to this place."

Even though I am not the most social person, I have felt very comfortable with this experience. Dan and Henry make everyone feel at home. The food is superb and the wine pairings are excellent. In addition it is a great place to share your current travel experiences and obtain excellent advice and recommendations."

For the whole duration our food was constantly replenished so nobody goes home hungry and when we had had enough we were given pots to take home what we wanted (which was everything btw). The service was excellent, personal and prompt. If you want to eat here, pre-book a table, they were having to turn people away."

I guess they were trying to avoid everyone sitting down for dinner at the same time.  The service was very professional albeit a little reserved but I guess that is what they are aiming for. The food generally was excellent and the wine pairings were in the main great.  Highlights for us were the fish course with razor clams and also the lobster. The meal was completed with a pastry served with cream flavoured with white pepper - delicious but very filling. The snail starter was OK but not something I would probably try again.  The only downside to our meal was the table of three women who spent the whole evening either taking selfies, playing music on their phones or talking loudly on their phones. Shame people like this are allowed!"

The concept is brilliant, educate the youth and they will improve themselves which will improve the country.  Needs our support.  But beware the road in and out - some potholes held together with bits of road."

Modern decor with lots of natural light.  Had a la carte of veal cheek and lobster to start , extremely tasty and beautifully presented. Not the biggest portions, but they do start you off with amuse buche and some delightful warm bread.  Mains of iberico pork and halibut, which again were delicious and delicately plated but with bold flavours and excellently seasoned.  Cheese trolley followed with a good mix of British and continental. These were very well described and waiters seemed knowledgeable on the flavours and the provenance.  A chocolate delight was then shared to round off an excellent afternoon.  Service was tremendous throughout, attentive but not overbearing with humour and personality.  Look forward to returning. I am sure it will be no time at all before they regain their star."

Not too expensive but not inexpensive either."

I tried snails for the first time and really enjoyed them. I had lamb navarin for my main; the meat was so tender and the fresh spring vegetables were perfect. DH started with pickled octopus and had swordfish for his main; he enjoyed both. We both finished with apple tart which was just ok. It is a very small restaurant so make sure you book."

The food prepared and superbly presented by the team originated from ancient recipes so it was quite different to what we were used to in Thailand. The meal was rounded off with (another) Birthday cake and a sing sing by the staff - not to be forgotten easily! Big Thank You all round and a lovely end to our 'short BUT sweet' trip here."

The cocktails are rife with strong Italian alcohols like Campari and vermouth, typical cocktails are Negronis and Old Fashioned. We tried both and they are well-fitting with the restaurant. It is impossible to choose one from Primi pasta dishes without regret that you have therefore missed another. When it\u2019s pasta time, go for Taglierini con Gamberetti e Carciofi \u2013 a rich, overwhelmingly savoury mix of the freshest pasta with brown shrimps and artichokes. I usually don\u2019t do this but we left our wine choices to the clued-up sommelier who really knew his stuff. In a tastefully decorated open-plan dining room that has plenty of space between the tables, he and his team offer a wide-ranging Italian menu with something for even the trickiest of eaters. Superb evening... flawless service and impeccable attention to detail. Yet another memorable night!"

The buffet is extensive. I especially liked the Dutch cheese and the crossaints. The service was very good. Especially the Western woman was so friendly with my small son. All in one it was a great place to have a breakfast!"

I wish i could have tasted the meat tartare too.. ;) The prices are vry reasonable. The staff is very friendly. A lot of locals eats there, so its always a good sign. We had lunch and it was very busy, I recommend reservation."

The welcome, the sweet attentive service supervised by pro teachers and the quality of the food served are impressive, even more so considering both kitchen and service is manned by young students. This small school is impressively committed to fighting poverty and human trafficking via vocational training. Sala Bai enrolls only the most disfavored Cambodian youths and provides a year long hospitality training (plus housing, food, clothing, health care etc) absolutely free of charge. All students (70% young ladies, the most exposed) are then employed by upscale hotels in Siem Reap. This has broken the evil circle of poverty for now thousands of families. I lift my hat to this achievement and encourage you to book a lunch! Thank you."

What a job the Team does... the lunch menu was exciting and came out just excellent - this at a very very fair cost. The juices and shakes are fresh, yummy and super well made, the service flawless and the greeting is the warmest. I rounded up with a very good and relaxing massage. The treatment rooms are large, clean and have nothing to envy the large fine hotel spas (I know them as well!).  When in Siem Reap, don't miss the chance to come and support a fantastic vocational hospitality school for underprivileged local youth. Bravo Sala Bai!"

A hospitality old timer, the little Siem Reap Sala Bai Hotel School has captured my heart & soul through its commitment, tuition quality, consistency, humanity and performance. Check their website as SB closes 2-3 months in summer before greeting new students. Returning as often as possible I know them now a bit. The lunch (part of practical training) is always good and of very good value and quality. Choice of well composed Khmer or Western light set menus; I have never been disappointed. The fully inexperienced Khmer youngsters come straight from the absolutely most disfavored rural communities and show extraordinary will and pride in learning. You'd be amazed at what they can perform after a couple of initial training months - starting from literally nothing at all in terms of hospitality & what foreign or Local guests might expect. Photos from I accompanied SB social worker on very! rural field family visits. I congratulate all active and involved. And I recommend you to book a little ahead. Enjoy!"

We did order a salad to go with it and although tasty, was nothing like the salad in the photos online. We would use this venue again. Not a large menu, but a tasty one."

            "review": "We had lunch at this restaurant on Sunday July 6th.  When we had visited this restaurant, several years back, we were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance and quality of food. So when we arrived in NYC this 4th of July weekend, Utsav was the 1st restaurant that came to mind for Indian food. I made a reservation to make sure we had a place.  We arrived with a lot of anticipation, but were utterly disappointed, by the time we left.  The restaurant started us of on the wrong foot, by stacking up unclean plates. Every plate we picked up (from the stack of plates provided) had food particles stuck to the bottom. Either their dishwasher was spoilt, or whoever was washing the dishes, did a shoddy job. I had to pick through at least 10 plates (supposedly clean) before getting hold of a \u201csomewhat clean plate\u201d.  At the Appetizer counter, there was a man preparing chat. I asked him for a helping, and was told that they will bring it to our table. By the time we left, no one had bothered to get us the chat.  The food quality was well below average, and not commensurate of a restaurant charging over $20/person for the buffet. There were very few items, both for the vegetarian and the non-vegetarian palate. The food tasted like \u201cproduction line\u201d preparation. There were two desert dishes that were clearly below par.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Indian food. Utsav has clearly lost its edge."

The service was quite good, timing good as well and the food was very nice. The restaurant prides itself on the different types of salts it uses and they even have a lovely guy named Ton who is the salt sommelier. The prices aren't cheap, but they are in range with the other resorts and restaurants in the area. Would recommend for a nice meal out."

Walked in about 20 minutes early and the owner immediately knew our reservation. He seated the 4 of us at an odd table right up in front of the bar. We were unsure, but as the evening unfolded we learned this was exactly the spot to have. He could watch over us from the bar like a wonderful host. We also learned he custom made the table which worked out exceptionally well. He made the wine suggestions which were spot on. Every course was wonderful. I have never taken photos of my food, but there is first time for everything. We left feeling we were leaving someones home. A night to remember and he and the staff were gracious to our limited French, we even shared laughs about how bad we were in the language department."

We booked via WhatsApp (which their website details) only an hour before they were opening and got a very quick response. I\u2019ll get my only slight criticism out of the way! It\u2019s a little bit cramped, but it\u2019s so popular I can\u2019t blame them for accommodating as many people as possible. We weren\u2019t keen on the high seats at barrel tables that we were initially allocated, but there was no problem at all in offering us alternative seating at a table. So, onto the food! It\u2019s simply exceptional. The ordering process is such a great idea, with you ticking the boxes next to your choices. We had 5 veggie & vegan dishes that were absolutely superb. In fact the beet hummus with chicory dressed with fig balsamic was one of the best things I\u2019ve ever eaten! My husband and son also had a fish dish and desserts, which they said were equally outstanding. Finally, we couldn\u2019t believe how hard the 2 owners worked. Nothing was too much trouble, and they clearly love what they do. Highly recommended without hesitation."

We start with an aperitif and a couple of \"cicchetti\", the menu offers both a choice of tasting and an a la carte menu, we decided to order a la carte, tuna tartare (exquisite), cappelletti of veal and pappardelle with beef sauce (braised), both dishes fantastic to remember the Italian cuisine of the best traditions. Faraona ripiena, delicious, crispy on the surface with a melting filling. I believe that the quality of the dishes shows the competence and love of Theo Randall for the raw materials, the ingredients and the care and passion he puts into the preparations together with his excellent team. The dessert, ricotta cheesecake, was also very good, with a welcome addition of good wishes for me. Excellent wine list from which we chose a Nebbiolo delle Langhe by Ascheri 2019, very good. I had a perfect evening from all points of view. Thanks to Theo and his team!"

The amok fish and beef salad is excellent!  However, their service is a little off. They overlooked one of our orders, and we waited for almost 30 minutes for it to be served, we followed it up and it was really overlooked. the manager was apologetic but it's really no big deal.  A French lady approached us and said she's the communication manager (?) for sala bai. She asked if the food was good and to post our comments on trip advisor.  Food was good, service is 4/5. After all, this is a training school. We came here for the good food and the server still has a lot of training to go through.  A little suggestion: I hope they would put a road sign at the corner of dela paix and Phum tapoul street so tourists who prefer to walk would find it easier."

Most guests take a tuktuk or hire a private van. I suggest the management should post a road sign at the corner of dela paix and taphoul street so it would be easier for people to locate it.  On the lighter note, the food was worth the trip. The beef salad and amok fish is by far the best I had tasted in Cambodia. The beef steak w/ potato was good but the beef is not tender and hard to slice (they didn't provide steak knife). The seafood w/ rice is too salty.  The server overlooked one of our orders in which we followed up after almost half hour. The manager was apologetic afterwards.  The French lady (communication manager?) approached us and all the other guests.  Overall, this trip is indeed a meal for a cause."

            "review": "We came here for dinner on the night we landed in Paris. Our flight was supposed to arrive at 8:20pm, and their last order was at 10:15pm (be aware that even though they offer 10:30pm reservations on La Fourchette, they don't actually do that), so I initially canceled because I was worried we'd miss the reservation. They were exceedingly nice and understanding during the email exchange, and so when we arrived on time and realized we could still make it, we had our hotel call them, and they were able to accommodate us.  Particularly for a late night dinner, the meal was better than I could have expected. The servers were kind and didn't rush us at all even though we ordered the chef's menu. Particularly memorable was the artichoke soup which was divine, the best I'd ever had with bits of artichoke mixed in with the velvety smooth soup. My husband, who is usually a non-meat eater, said the lamb was one of the best he had tasted. If you come here, you must have the bread, even if you are trying to cut down on carbs. It's absolutely delicious. On this night, we had something that looked like parker rolls, but actually tasted like a nice focaccia, and a perfectly baked sourdough slice.  If you are a dessert lover like me, you will love the long list of some of the most scrumptious choices I've seen at a restaurant in a long time. The menu came with a caramel mille-feuille, which I enjoyed, but I also saw tantalizing plates of souffl\u00e9s, berry tarts etc etc making its way toward other tables. I would love to come and just eat all of their desserts.  The restaurant was located inside the Bristol hotel, which is a former palace. The warm and unpretentious service combined with the amazing food even made me curious about staying here next time.  Pricewise, this is a one Michelin restaurant, so it's in the typical range of similarly rated establishments. Frankly, however, this was a better meal than two-Michelin places we've been to on out previous trip two months ago, so from that perspective we considered it to be, maybe not a bargain, but completely worth it."

Food was amazing indeed! Both flavor and serving size was big! We ordered amok, lok lak and tom yum soup plus lime cucumber (not sure what the name was) shake. If only I had more days there, I would definitely keep trying out their other dishes. Can't wait to eat here again when I come back to Siem Reap."

We returned it. The chef even said it smelled bad - so why send it out to your customers. Absolutely pathetic"

It gave our family an insight in to Khmer culture and way of living. The restaurant has a great vibe and is well priced. Would return if we are in Siem Reap again."

            "review": "Good- but overrated\u2026 We looked forward to our dinner at Pur , but were disappointed in the menu. There were only four entr\u00e9es to choose from and one was a cheese platter. The other entr\u00e9e choices were sea bass , wyagu beef and sweet breads. My husband wanted none of them however he chose the wyagu beef. The sauce for the beef was excellent and he enjoyed it however at \u20ac135 it should be more than very good . I ordered the Seabass and found it adequate. The risotto with curry that came with the beef also had an excellent sauce. Some of the servers, including James and Amin, were very good. Leopold never brought the citrus vinaigrette I requested and seemed to completely forget it. He also had to be asked to serve us bread. There were many \u201cextras\u201d that were provided at no charge,but being very gourmet,required a receptive palate. I loved the artichoke appetizer bite with curry,but my husband didn\u2019t care for any of them. We ordered a la carte,but with a \u20ac90 bottle of wine ( which was the least expensive Bordeaux on the menu) and coffee, our bill before tip was \u20ac333. We are world travelers and have stayed at some of the best hotels. Overall, I would give the food a B-. My husband gave it a much lower rating than that. If we had ordered the six course fixed menu with wine, the bill would have been well over \u20ac600. You would have had the same four entrees as well. Interesting experience, but we would never go back."

            "review": "We only stayed at La Siesta Trendy for two nights and on the first night in Vietnam we had to have the obligatory street food which was great. For the second night, and after a very long day of touring the city, we decided to have dinner at The Red Bean. Greeted by friendly staff at the lift door, we were ushered to an intimate table and offered a menu with a great selection of dishes and drinks including cocktails. For cocktails we had: The Naked Man Pina Colada Both very moorish, so we had seconds at the end of our meal! We would recommend the spring rolls platter which had two fresh rolls, two crispy seafood rolls and two crispy Hanoi pork rolls. This was followed by a beautifully presented steaming bowl of pho. The pho at the restaurant was a delicately flavoured broth with rice noodles and tender beef. It was different to the rustic flavours you\u2019d get from street food vendors and equally as wonderful. Every pho recipe has some hidden secrets and this was evident in the subtlety different flavours. Mango sticky rice wrapped up the evening and the warm coconut flavoured rice with sweet mango was everything that I was expecting and looking forward to trying for the first time. It was a great restaurant choice for our last night in Hanoi and if we are ever here again we will definitely visit."

We couldn't get a table booked online, so had to find our way to the restaurant and just hope we could get a table..  On arrival it was busy, and it was mostly local people eating here, not many tourists at time of our visit..  Very warm welcome from front of house and it's a warm, genuine greeting..  Absolutely NO ALCOHOLIC beverages served here, so if you want alcohol with your meal, then sorry, this isn't right place for you..  But if you want an authentic ambience, great welcome and really genuine Turkish food, then you'll enjoy eating here...  Not easy to find as it's slightly off the main area of tourist haunts..  One app that will help guide you through the streets to find this restaurant, put MAPS.ME on your phone...  No Internet requirement, as it uses GPS signal..  From Hagia Sofia Square, follow up the hill where the Trams go, find Burger King.. Turn left so BK is on your right... Follow this road down to a junction in the road.. The old Cistern is on left of junction..  There's a small road sharp right, don't take that road.. Take next right.. Follow down, to fork in road.. Keep left, keep walking and Restaurant comes up on your right..."

My husband and I shared the tomato bruschetta. Very fresh and displayed wonderfully. My husband chose the lamb ragout with gnocchi and I had the tortellini. Both were well presented and yum. The chef came out to our table to say hello and twisted our arms for dessert. My husband had the pannacotta. I had the chocolate fondant. Omg! It was to die for! Would say best I have ever had. Will definitely be back and recommend to anyone."

And we are very happy we did. Food offers and spreads are great.For starters, they had so many appetisers and soups including their culinary masterpiece and favourite Tom Yang. This time it's on the light side version as against the heavy soup that is typically served. Great variety of Japanese and international cuisine : bacon, sausages, ham, omelletes,sushi bar, salad bar, desserts: local fruits like dragon fruit, pineapple,jackfruit, etc. A great way to start the day of beautiful memories. Of course, one can also order a la carte for set breakfast menus which in itself is very generous in serving size. Be early coz waiting time can be challenging."

I didn't particularly like the selection of starters. The vegetarian starter included fried spring rolls, which are unusual in a Thai restaurant (they usually have the type with rice paper that are not fried), and deep fried, battered vegetables, which in my view defeat the purpose of eating vegetables. I did not order wine, but my friends did not care for the wine selections--surprising since it is not difficult to find good wine in New Zealand. The wait staff was good-natured, but not at all knowledgeable about wine."

There was a small hickup with the starter, I simply did not get it, and by I asked for it again, the main meal came, but I got a small beer as a compensation. Friendly staff. Even if I most likely will not live close to Tufnell Park on my next visit, I will take the tube, to visit the restaurant again, its very close to the station."

Had the beef and pork tacos. Dont know why some of the reviews on here say they are small, they are well ample and up to spec on what you would expect for a taco anywhere.  Well flavoured, easy to eat. Love the atmosphere of the small bar/small food joint scene and this place is small and rocking.  The banter from the staff was epic as well. Overall a great experience."

Great restaurant, menu, service, and vibe for Argentinean grill!  We had the Arugula Salad with Parmesan, and it was excellent. They dress it for you too.  For lunch, we ordered the \"Tablita de Carne\" which is a 2pp platter of grilled meat. Was excellent too. But the best was the Paillard de Lomo - probably in the top 5 steaks I've had in the world. Trust me on this one. I also tasted the Medallon de Lomo (the thick cut) and it was insanely delicious too. We had a side of papas fritas too, which were huge.  In all, this is a very nice restaurant, not quite \"fine dining\" but in that genre. You will want to come back!"

            "review": "Over the years I\u2019ve come to expect Ml\u00fdnec to deliver a very good festival menu, which is why this restaurant was the fourth and last round with my Danish friends before they headed back home. It is safe to say that the restaurant didn\u2019t disappoint. We were all blown away by the experience. We were greeted by the manager (I believe) and sat down at a nice table. The interior of the restaurant has been redone, and we liked it. Particularly we liked the acoustics of the room. Noise doesn\u2019t travel from table to table, and we could have a relaxed conversation without raising our voices or listening in on whatever was being discussed by the table next to ours. We had a bowl of bread with 3 different kinds of fresh and slightly warm bread. It was accompanied by a herb spread which had nice, subtle flavours and a perfect temperature. I wanted more bread! But thank God they didn\u2019t give me any (I didn't ask for it), because we were all completely full, when we left the restaurant a couple of hours later. The amuse bouche was delicate foam of smoked potatoes. There were some crunchy bits on top and a bit of sour notes from tiny pieces of pickled vegetables as well. These 2 elements gave some texture, and it was a brilliant little dish. The starter was smoked char with almond milk \u201ccaviar\u201d, beluga lentils, horseradish, and marjoram. The trout had a firm, yet tender texture and had received just the right amount of smoke. The subtle horseradish sauce with marjoram complimented both fish and lentils very well and made everything come together. The lentils were perfectly cooked \u2013 I am not sure if \u201cal dente\u201d is a way to describe lentils, but I\u2019ll risk it. The almond milk caviar was mainly on the plate for texture, I believe \u2013 it didn\u2019t pack a lot of flavour. I like that the \u201ceggs\u201d had different sizes. That worked well visually and also when it came to the texture. The size of the portion was generous \u2013 we all agreed that it wouldn\u2019t have been strange at all, if they had served one piece of trout instead of the two nice portions on our plates. The main dish was veal rib eye, beans, dried beef, beets, cashews, and demi glace. We were given a choice how we would like our meat prepared, and we all chose medium. Mine was closer to medium rare, and that was perfectly fine with me. The first impression of the dish came from tasting the demi glace, which was one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. Only the master of sauces, Steven Trumpfheller, has served me a better one. So rich and full of flavour and reduced to the point where it would make my lips stick together. The steak was tender and well seasoned, and it hade more and deeper flavour than I would have expected from veal \u2013 more like a young bull. There were 3 different types of beans on the side, all cooked to perfection. The beets added an earthy and sweet/sour dimension, and the small bites of smoked and dried beef held it together, although my first bite was very tough (the rest weren\u2019t). Just as it was the case with the starter, everything on the plate created a perfect combination, and the dish was quite filling. I regretted not having saved a slice of bread to wipe my plate clean with. Not to embarrass my two friends at the table I decided not to lick the sauce off my plate, but the thought crossed my mind. The dessert was macaroon in two ways, cherry, chocolate, tangerine, and basil garnished with raspberries and a blackberry. The macaroon on the side was good, but to me the star of the dish was the clever composition in the middle. I tried tasting the different elements individually, and they went almost all the way around the palate, except for saltiness. Sweet, sour, tart, bitter. And then when they all met in combination with the chewy and a little bit gooey macaroon bottom, it was simply a heavenly mouthful. The menu mentions a pre-dessert as a palate cleanser. Previously it has been a ball of sorbet. They forgot to serve it at our table, but they found out and insisted that we had coffee on the house, accompanied with cute cubes of chocolaty caramel. It was a nice finish to our meal. The service was friendly and attentive, and we were given plenty of time between dishes, which we really appreciate. We were served by different waiters, but the manager always kept an eye on our table and checked every once in a while if we were happy \u2013 and it was a pleasure chatting with him. Hospitality must lie in his genes. We agreed that this final festival experience was a perfect ending to this year\u2019s adventure as a group \u2013 and most definitely we\u2019re looking forward to repeating it next year! There are 2 seats left for the Restaurant festival at Ml\u00fdnec this year: 1 seat on the 12/2 at 17:30 and 1 on the 16/2 at 17:30. Grab them!"

The menu changes from week to week. The price is Czk. 1.290, - per person. It includes prosecco, red wine, white wine, beer, coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice and other soft drinks ad libitum. My boss, who is pretty awesome - and has asked me out several times this week - is in Prague with her husband, and I thought it appropriate to ask them out, just once. We usually attend the Grand Restaurant Festival together, but that\u2019s not an option this year. Instead we\u2019ve designed our own culinary week. The menu we had yesterday is below. Food is served at the table. We were given dishes to share, and we were pleased with the portion sizes, which allowed us to taste everything. By the time we had done that, we were also absolutely stuffed. Everything we were served was impressively delicious. The praise came in a stream from all three of us. We were impressed with the quality of the prosecco and wines included in what was effectively an all-you-can-drink package. The service was also absolutely perfect. The team of waiters were quite young and they were well trained in the profession, they were polite, friendly, helpful and had both humour and the courage to bring their personalities to work. When we arrived at 11:30, we discussed whether we could have arrived a little later and still had plenty of time before 15:00. But the service was kind enough to give us plenty of time between courses, we had a good time - and by 14:35 we were ready for dessert, which by the way was a feast of flavours and textures and one of the many highlights of the brunch. We'll be back!

This is the Restaurant to go if you in Siem Reap."
