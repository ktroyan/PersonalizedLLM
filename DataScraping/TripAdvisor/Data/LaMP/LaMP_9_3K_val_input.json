Our food was truly excellent in every respect, Juraj helped with wine choices using his expert knowledge - the Moravian reisling was really good. Overall we cannot fault our visit to v Zatisi, we very much look forward to next time and have already recommended this restaurant to several friends. Thank you all so much."

We decided to have a stroll around some of Lisbons many bars and eateries and graze on some of the fantastic food. ( well that was the plan ) We both liked the look of Grau Douro from the reviews and found the establishment very easily in Rua Dunques de Braganca. On arrival the small (but cosy) place was very busy and having no booking we were offered a seat at the bar.This offer was accepted and the owner came straight over with the drinks menu , we are not knowledgeable about Portuguese wine so asked for some guidance. He asked what we liked and suggested a couple of wines ( neither were expensive) and promptly poured a taste of each, followed by a full measure. We quaffed the lovely wine ordered some more and asked for the food menu. The owner who was clearly in control of the whole show was exhilarating to watch , moving from table to table , laughing and joking with the customers and even playing the accordion from time to time a delight to observe. The food arrived Covert ( bread with oil ) the Prawns in garlic sauce and a portion of Bacalhau a bras (codfish , slices of potato and egg cooked in the oven) both dishes were absolutely delicious. Unfortunately by siting at the bar the Toucinho do Ceo do Avo ( Grandpa`s Heavenly Tart ) was positioned on the bar top just in front of us , so a portion along with a very nice glass of port had to be consumed to finish the night. Everything about the place is fantastic, the food is amazing , the staff are friendly and great , the atmosphere is homely , all in all a great find , needless to say we only managed the one bar that night best laid plans and all that. Grau Douro thankyou for a Fantastic Evening. We will be back."

What I was served was a cold glass of wine. It either not what he showed me or an opened bottle that was in The fridge. Somewhat disappointing. The satay presentation was good - but the chicken was chewy and lacked a proper seasoning. The service was very good."

Slightly disappointed we didn\u2019t arrive hungrier after having a big lunch as what we did have was so delicious we would have liked to taste more. We had prawns, chorizo and chicken wings. Prawns and chorizo were delicious - would pass on the wings. Shared an almond torte for dessert which was amazing. Small and good vibe bar and restaurant. Lovely bottle of wine, great atmosphere, very attentive friendly service from the owner and good tunes. If we come back to Lisbon we would definitely go back and we highly recommend."

            "review": "We visited last Friday evening.  The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."

I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.  The points above wouldn\u2019t stop me from visiting again but there\u2019s room for improvement."

It is extremely good value for money considering the quality of food, ambience and service.  You can get 2 courses for $12 or 3 courses for $15 including one glass of wine or a soft drink. I found out about the business lunch menu from other TA reviews.  Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t afford to visit Chi restaurant for tasting menus that they offer in the evening but this was perfect.  The manager Sarah even came to introduce herself during our meal.  I would definitely like to visit again with hubby."

I ordered the paneer tikka masala which was delicious and they were generous with the paneer which I appreciated. The mango lassi was also very tasty. Pricing is similar to other Indian restaurants in town but I would say Rasoi Ghar is one of the better Indian restaurants that I\u2019ve tried in Siem Reap and I\u2019ve tried a fair few."

Along with the traditional fillings they also offer a wide variety of savoury and sweet ones not to mention that their cocktails are amazing! The restaurant itself is a gorgeous place to spend time. The owners have kept the number of tables low for the amount of space they have and the result is well worth it. Be aware if you want to visit on the weekends however, this place is extremely popular and is usually fully booked! I would recommend WILD to anyone looking for a relaxed atmosphere and delicious food."

The recommendation is to stay at Anantara to maximize this amazing restaurant.If you are not staying at Anantara I suggest you visit Chi at least once.The restaurant has everything one would want for a quiet family or romantic dinner. Great wine selection.Every dish from starter to dessert, a masterpiece. The signature dishes are to die for. The staff is very helpful and attentive. Since we were staying at the resort, we had an opportunity to have daily breakfast at Chi. There was a great buffet layout plus one can select signature dishes from a la carte menu which is included in the price of breakfast. It was so nice to see F&B manager Mr Sheldon talking to the guest making sure everything is good, we had a specific request for our main course and it was accommodated. Their prawn curry was just awesome and my daughter fell in love with their chicken Korage and salt pepper calamari. Every meal we were served was of the exceptional standard even at the room service. Their signature Crab cake is a must and if you have breakfast at Chi, order their signature waffles and eggs. (yummy). i highly recommend 'Chi'.Take it from a foodie!! 0"

I dined at a table outside; lots of shady characters hanging about so it wasn't a relaxing experience at all. If you must eat here then get a table inside at least.

Nonetheless Simone was a wonderful host, service was excellent,aperitif drinks were nicely and generously prepared and desserts were very good as was the espresso.So all in all we will return and try hard not to compare it to the food we get served in Puglia...."

The menu is small, but has a good enough selection of different dishes. We chose a salad and calamari as an appetizer, which were very nicely presented, but the taste of the salad sauce was just delicious! For main course I had the Paella, beautifully presented and extremely tasty and my wife the fish dish - very fresh and also delicious. We will be back soon again!"

The event runs three times a week in a space that is typically reserved for a wine club. Although our group had about 20 people in it, it served to be a very intimate experience. The night began with a toast and traditional appetizers while mingling with other guests and staff. We continued by a nice presentation of the food and an introduction to the evening by the staff. Next, we sat down for a wonderful dinner - each part of which was superb. My boyfriend's favorite part of the evening was being able to head outside on the balcony with Luis, who showed him grilling techniques and talked about his experience with gastronomy. The food, wine, and company were all wonderful, and we loved being able to meet people during such an enjoyable experience - we have even kept in contact with a few! The staff was absolutely fantastic. Luis was happy to share his knowledge, Pierre was knowledgable and very interesting to talk with, and the rest of the staff was superb as well. A definite highlight of our trip!"

Unfortunately it didn't. 4 slices ( I thought pizzas meant to be huge in the USA) and tasted of nothing.  Very disappointed and would not return."

            "review": "In Paris, the competition in the fine dining category is fierce.  It\u2019s as if every night is a playoff game and everyone is gunning for the title. Here, a Michelin Star might actually be worth more than in other cities. And if you\u2019re lucky enough to be on vacation, with back-to-back dinners at this level, you would imagine that someone has to lose. It was with this pressure we dined at Pur, having just experienced newly starred Saturne the night before.  Would there be space for its unique take on starred excellence?  Pur is a classic fine dining experience. This is not a let down. Imagine the finest ingredients in unique combinations. Now imagine them served at a level that take six dishes and create wonderful arc.  While identifying individual dishes is useless as Chef Aie Okabayashi is sure to adjust the menu based on what\u2019s seasonal, the one prevailing taste we encountered was \u201csmoke\u201d. Similar to the essence of barbecue, there were hits of smoke and wood in unexpected delicate places like fish. Yes there was a duck course that was one of the best\u2026the skin by alone could have been a delicacy.  Lest we forget, two of the six courses were desserts, with a palate cleanser that could be a dish in itself. Actually, the that cleaner tart \u201csouffl\u00e9\u201d was probably our favorite, and the pastry chef, who busily prepped dishes all night next to our chef\u2019s table, humbly admitted it was his as well.  We opted not to commit to the wine pairings, but the Sancerre and Margeux by the glass were excellent. If you prefer cocktails, their take on the Moscow Mule is worth the price. And don\u2019t be intimidated by the six-courses. It\u2019s the right size and takes about three hours, so it was well-paced.  Finally, the service was superb. It doesn\u2019t hurt that we were seated at the chef\u2019s table with a window into the kitchen where Chef was making sure no detail was overlooked. And yes she made one trainee remake a simple amuse-bouche simply because he failed to sprinkle the dust in the right direction. And an anniversary cake for a couple celebrating theirs was reset because it sat a few minutes too long.  Situated in the sexy Park Hyatt Vendome, this is far more than a \u201chotel\u201d restaurant. It\u2019s epic\u2026they brought their A-game on an average Tuesday evening. But hey, this is Paris, and the next Michelin wannabe is right around the corner!  The good news is that Pur has the goods, elegance and fine creations, to keep that star shining."

The food is over the top good. \u201cThat\u2019s the best chicken satay I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d \u201cThe schnitzel is awesome,\u201d and we\u2019ve lived in Germany. \u201cThe curry is frickin great, why cant they have a \u2018all you can eat menu?\u2019\u201d OK. That wasn\u2019t actually said but I did think it. The deserts were awesome as well. And what the owners/directors are doing for young Cambodians is worthy of your patronage and a healthy tip."

Bella Cucina is only a small restaurant with the kitchen/pizza oven centre to the room. The menu changes almost daily to some extent, and is not extensive but covers you for choice nicely. Don't load up on bread first (the garlic bread is a pizza size) as the main dishes are plentiful servings. Gnocchi was terrific. Dessert of tiramisu was excellent. The staff member at reception and serving tables was so calm, unflustered and efficient, always with a smile despite the constant queue of people out the door. Would definitely recommend and return."

The food is great (I am vegan and they do have a vegan brunch, or a smoothie bowl) ) and the staff very pleasant and helpful.  If you are into the pastry/sweet cakes there is a lot of choice and everything is made fresh on the premises.  They also often have freshly made jam and peanut butter - certainly worth buying to take with you.  You can also order bread (the day before) which is freshly baked on the premises - and its healthy as well!  Bayon Pastry School is a training facility for girls/women who would otherwise struggle to get a reasonable job. Here they are taught the fine art of making pastries, cakes etc. and then have a great start to getting a decent paying job at the end of their 12 months training."

We preordered halal so lamb was available for us which was wow.  The halibut fish was perfection and now the Souffl\u00e9 was something else. The pistachio flavours making it a treat.  The starters we had the celeriac and the lobster which were a delight. the rosemary bread was soft and warm.  The service was fantastic friendly and very attentive.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for a beautiful couples dinner or a business lunch."

Decent place and we ordered our dishes as well as butter chicken. It tasted nothing like butter chicken and we told the manager about it. I appreciate the fact that they listened to our complain and acknowledged the same. They also took of the charges off our final bill. Other then this everything else was good. Service also has a scope for improvement. Overall I would recommend this place for Indian food."

I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.  The points above wouldn\u2019t stop me from visiting again but there\u2019s room for improvement."

It is extremely good value for money considering the quality of food, ambience and service.  You can get 2 courses for $12 or 3 courses for $15 including one glass of wine or a soft drink. I found out about the business lunch menu from other TA reviews.  Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t afford to visit Chi restaurant for tasting menus that they offer in the evening but this was perfect.  The manager Sarah even came to introduce herself during our meal.  I would definitely like to visit again with hubby."

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."

The meal was good Italian food with the only slight negative being a limited menu. Pasta dishes were plentiful. The truffle pasta is highly recommended."

For the non-egg eater, the mushroom/truffle salad was light, refreshing and tasty.  The staff were outstanding. Thoroughly attentive, chatty and friendly, and the pacing of the meal was perfect.  Changes? The lamb main course was tiny. Throwing an extra lamb variant (maybe lamb three ways, not two) would avoid the noticeable disappointment when the dish arrives. Or through another piece of the loin on the plate.  The wine pairings were excellent especially the use of one of the Orin Swift varietals for the main course."

We came without expectations as we were staying at Renaissance Hotel and needed dinner. We were blown away.  The staff are lovely, pleasant. Hervina the restaurant manager was accommodating to our needs.  We had the sea urchin and scallop for entree. Over ordered our mains by adding the skewer special. Full we still attempted a dessert as all the dishes came out beautiful and delicious.  The only dish I probably have a slight complain about is the Flexi Ganache (dessert) I felt to achieve the aesthetic, the ganache was too gelatinous. The mint, lemon, chocolate and meringue combination however was well done.  Recommended!"

Prices were reasonable compared to US, UK and Australia. Would highly recommend one meal here."

When we were there for lunch, some of them came in tour groups and occupied rows of tables, so clearly seats will fill up easily. Make a reservation to avoid disappointment.  The food was so-so - we ordered from the set menu so we had a choice between the Western set and the Asian set. For the price we paid, the food was not bad. It was interesting to watch the trainee staff learning on the job.  If you wish to tip them, do so at a box at the entrance of the restaurant - when we visited, they were raising money to go on a class trip together during their vacation."

I also had the dragonfruit smoothie bowl for breakfast yesterday and it looked and tasted so good, went down well with my turmeric latte. The staff are always friendly here and the prices are really good, It also has a beautiful cool breeze always coming through, so nice after the heat outside, I love this place and always come back."

We stopped in here several nights on our week's trip to Queenstown and the staff even remembered us (which is amazing given the amount of people that they see each day!). It was popular with the 18-25 crowd as well as those of us 40+  Totally recommend this bar for a visit if you're in town!"

We shared everything. We were sad we couldn't eat more. I can't wait to go back. Bring cash because they do not accept credit cards. Not expensive. Food can compete with any Chinese restaurant in the city."

The foie gras starter was special. Best if the mains for us was the calf cheeks."

            "review": "We stayed at the Anantara resort for our honeymoon and ate here twice.  Sea.Fire.Salt is the premier eaterie at both Anantara and Marriott. It's more of a fine dining experience than other restaurants we ate at and it's fronted by the excellent, well travelled, French maitre d', Laurant. Who's a nice guy and very informative on your food and wine if you need him to be. First time here we had the mixed seafood brick (scallops, prawn, sea bass) and the mixed grill (lamb chop, steak, chicken) bricks. The searing hot Himalayan salt bricks are maybe a little bit of artistic licence and whether or not they contribute anything other than a hot, salty brick to your meal I wouldn't know. But they do make the difference of bringing something unique and interesting to the table. Food was very good, well presented with potato and vegetable sides. Handmade Sorbet deserts are delicious. As always in Asia, red wine served chilled, why do you do that? 2nd time we ate here was the last night of our stay, because it's a very nice place and it's nice being spoiled occasionally. Outrageously juicy Wagyu and Sirloin steaks served with a selection of salts that vary in colour, texture and taste, Very nice. I spoke to front of house when I arrived and was delighted when they managed to find me a non-chilled, perfect temperature bottle of red wine to enjoy with my steak. It completed my meal and I'm grateful for the efforts that were made. Food here is certainly not cheap, but it's good. Undoubtedly you're paying a little extra for the whole outdoor, on the seafront, well presented, himalayan brick, finer experience. Which I enjoyed. And I'd eat there again. Tr\u00e8s Bien"

The soft shell salt and pepper crab and the yellow beef curry were to DIE for! Thank you Chef Tham for your gracious hospitality. We keep coming back here...keep up the fantastic standard."

I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.  The points above wouldn\u2019t stop me from visiting again but there\u2019s room for improvement."

It is extremely good value for money considering the quality of food, ambience and service.  You can get 2 courses for $12 or 3 courses for $15 including one glass of wine or a soft drink. I found out about the business lunch menu from other TA reviews.  Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t afford to visit Chi restaurant for tasting menus that they offer in the evening but this was perfect.  The manager Sarah even came to introduce herself during our meal.  I would definitely like to visit again with hubby."

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."

We took \u201cLe tajine des gazelle\u201d with a mix of dry fruits (apricot, almond, lemon) and a traditional couscous. The plates are generous and homemade, so savoury! For 10\u20ac you will enjoy the plenty of Marrakech. Waiters are so kind! You have to try this amazing little restaurant!"

It's quite small with seating for 6 or 7 at the counter/bar at the back of which the chef is preparing the food as you order it and 3 or 4 tables for 2. You could happen to be lucky and drop by but it's makes more sense to believe all the positive reviews and make a booking before you plan to go. It's a joy, the two guys and lady who run the place are really engaging and welcoming and of course, the tapas style food is tasty and good value and as the title suggests, they know their wine and are happy to make suggestions around matching."

Each course was flavorful with premium ingredient and original presentation. Service was friendly, attentive and efficient. The wine pairing although expensive really helped bring an additional dimension to the food with the sommelier walking us through each pairing in details.  Overall we had a wonderful night at Jungsik and even though it's not as well known as some of the other high-end restaurants in New York, we highly recommend you give it a shot!"

As others have mentioned this is a fixed menu only type of restaurants so you need to be flexible but what came out of the kitchen on the night we were there did not disappoint one bit. What was interesting is that unlike many of the other restaurants we went to during our trip to France, Aspic offered a wine pairing with the meal which was quite nice and added an extra layer to the experience.  Service was overall good but you need to go into this with the right expectation that this is a lean operation. As far as I could tell there was the chef in the kitchen and one waitress for about 12 tables. It didn't feel slow or anything but it wasn't \"high touch\" either.  Overall we were pleasantly surprised with the experience. When the check came in, we were even more surprised at how affordable this experience was. Given the quality and creativity, I don't think it's going to stay this way for long so you better go and enjoy it!"

For the non-egg eater, the mushroom/truffle salad was light, refreshing and tasty.  The staff were outstanding. Thoroughly attentive, chatty and friendly, and the pacing of the meal was perfect.  Changes? The lamb main course was tiny. Throwing an extra lamb variant (maybe lamb three ways, not two) would avoid the noticeable disappointment when the dish arrives. Or through another piece of the loin on the plate.  The wine pairings were excellent especially the use of one of the Orin Swift varietals for the main course."

Benihana is a legend in the teppanyaki cuisine and for what it is, it\u2019s fine. This is a place for food theatre where people go with their kids / friends for a fun evening.  Service \u2013 the service is good at this Benihana. The reception was nice and efficient and the waitresses are nice, drinks and non-teppanaki items served quickly and they did a good job with special requests on the table. Chefs were fun, engaged the kids and put on a good show for everyone.  Food \u2013 Ordered the cod with miso and a side of scallops. The fish was good enough, but the miso was added as a sauce (vs glazed on top) which was disappointing. The unique black cod taste was lost on the grill and the luscious oiliness of the fish was lost. My son ordered beef and eat everything as it was served medium so soft to eat in bite size pieces so he liked it. I am not a fan of the food and only attended on the request of my son.  Value \u2013 teppanyaki is always expensive. My young son and I had 2 mains, 1 starter and a glass of wine and it cost us \u00a390. Every time I pay the bill for a teppanyaki dinner, I vow never to come back and year after year the kids beg to come back for the show which obviously made the meal delicious to them.  Benhihana does the teppanyaki show well and kids and groups will enjoy the experience. It seems fully booked all the time so there is certainly an audience for it. But it is not good value for money, and the food is uninteresting and bland (even with their sauce options). If the kids have a great desire to go then we may consider going back, but never for any other reason."

                        "review": "This is a very pretty restaurant on the beachfront at the Anantara hotel. The location and set up is very nice, and having a meal beside the beach with the crashing waves in the background is very romantic and soaking with atmosphere and style.  Service: The service was exemplary as expected at an Anantara. Attentive, helpful, and unobtrusive. They were kind enough to help move us inside to the air conditioned space which helped when it became too hot. They explained much of the dishes to us as well which was nice. When we left they got us a buggy to the reception and called our hotel and asked them to send a buggy to collect us. We were very impressed and pleased with this.  Food: The menu is very limited with only a few options for starters, mains and desserts. I was hoping for more seafood dishes and options. Their hallmark dish was seafood cooked on top of salt bricks. Heating the bricks and cooking it on top allows the seafood to absorb some of the flavour of the exotic salts. It felt gimmicky and I could not really taste any great benefit. I ordered the prawn version and it tasted like regular grilled prawns and was nothing special. I hoped to have some of the famous Thai flavours and passion reflected in the food. But I found the meal a bit bland. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the food was fresh and all was very well executed but the mains were really not that interesting. The salt sommelier was there to assist with different types of salt to enhance your meal. I am a fan of interesting salts but again, this felt a bit forced. I could barely tell the difference between the salts and quite frankly, didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to really good, tasty seafood. The starters were very good \u2013 most especially the rocket and pear salad which was quite WOW but a very small portion. The desserts were nicely made but nothing extraordinary. There was also a seafood feast but for the price, did not seem well worth it.  Price: This place was very expensive. I dont normally mind paying for good food but this felt unnecessarily expensive for what it was. I love Ananatra as a hotel and frequently dine at their restaurants even when I am not staying with them but the pricing of the is menu felt much too expensive for the food you were getting. Even if the price were lower, I would not be keen to come back again as I don\u2019t find the food (except the salad) worth the inflated cost. It is a rarity that I do not like an Anantara establishment but the balance of value for money for atmosphere \u2013 made me feel disappointed.  I would not go back again for dinner as nothing interested my taste buds. I would not mind to have a drink or light snack there but as a dinner, I felt I could get better food, variety and price at one of the other dining options on the hotel property."

The ambiance is energetic and you can immediately feel that it is a place for friends and groups rather than a romantic dinner with your partner. The show is funny and the food is well cooked but not exceptional because it's not elaborated. I suggest it for a different experience but not as usual place to go."

Seating, server and delivery of our food. We especially enjoyed the drinks Hibiscus and Thai Ice Coffee. The desert topped off our mean Punkin Custard. The restaurant is small, so be prepared to share a table with others at lunch time when it's busy. We will be back to try other entrees, next time in area. Thank you."

We visited twice in our four days, once for a much needed liquid pitstop and the second time for dinner as the food we saw on our first visit look wonderful. The menu isn't huge but there are plenty of dishes to choose from. They also have a menu of the day priced around 100dhr which is unbelievable value for three courses and tea. a special shout out to our waiter Ismail, who assisted and guided us to our food selections. The food was excellent and extremely tasty."

            "review": "It is many years since our last visit to Theo Randall - the place has been brightened up considerably since our last visit and although the low ceiling will always remain it is not so noiticeable.  The restaurant features a regional menu which at \u00a350 including wine is excellent value for money - tonight's was from Emilia Romagna but our prefernce was from the wider A la Carte which is priced by the dish.  Starters of Minestrone and a Cheese souffle were both filling and delicious and mains of Pappardelle and Sea Bream very enjoyable. We finished with a shared Italian cheese course followed by a lovely soft chocolate cake.  The wine list is a lovely tour of Italian regions but there is a nice choice of wines by the glass enabling us to try a selection, the Jermann Pinot Grigio and Planeta Chardonnay both superb examples.  Service was friendly and efficient and we were much more impressed than on our previous visit."

What a view!  You get a perfect view of the blue mosque and hagia sophia from their outdoor patio. It is simply stunning.  But enough with the view, we're here to eat after all! And eat we did. This place has traditional Ottoman palace cuisine, which is simply decadent. We had lamb stuffed with pine nuts and raw almonds, which was so tender and tasty. We also had slow-cooked lamb wrapped in eggplant, which was melt-in-your-mouth good.  We were two very satisfied travelling Canadian foodies that afternoon!"

But other than the soup, none of the dishes were that great. The accompanying wines weren\u2019t anything special either - just common, everyday wines in quality. The experience was more about being in somebody\u2019s home and sharing conversation with a small group of people from around the world. At the price $80/pp plus tip, we found much better value elsewhere in Buenos Aires."

My son ordered the seasonal degustation and enjoyed it very much. Wine pairings were with generous pours, excellent whites and ok reds. Food presentation was good, Indian courses were tasty, the other courses a bit less flavorful. One star off because one of our dining partners ordered the steak and it was tough, requiring a lot of sawing to cut. Our wait staff were friendly with a great sense of humor, and overall we enjoyed the meal. Not sure we would return, as the price point was a bit high for the food quality."

Although the server told us that the pizza's were \"individual size\" - do not be fooled - these easily feed two. The four of us didn't even finish the two pies. The place does a high volume of deliveries - which leads me to believe they have a very large following of repeat customers.  One negative is that the tables are kind of small."

            "review": "We could not get a table at our hotel's Gourmet Corner restaurant at Le Siesta Diamond so the staff kindly recommended that we tried the Red Bean restaurant at their sister hotel at Le Siesta Central, a 10 minutes stroll. They made the reservation on our behalf and even escorted us to the restaurant - that is what I called 'good customer service'.  The Red Bean restaurant is situated at the foyer of the hotel and nicely laid out with a small bar. The ambience was good and the staff was attentive.  There is a lot to choose from the Menu, a combination of local Vietnamese and European food. As we have been in Hanoi for a few days and sampled quite a few local dishes, we decided to go for steak. We had tomato Rossini and fried vegetable spring rolls for our starters, followed by a tenderloin steak and a mushroom and aubergine claypot as our main courses. The food was gorgeous and very well presented. The portion size was just right for a fine dining. We had a flambe banana with ice cream and fresh fruit platter for our desserts.  We were not disappointed with the quality of food and service provided by yet another Le Siesta hotel which speaks volume for the Elegance Hotel Group. 3 of the EHG hotels have a Red Bean restaurants.  We were very pleased with our meal and thoroughly enjoyed our meal at the Red Bean and well done Le Siesta Diamond for recommending this restaurant.  Highly recommend that you give the Red Bean restaurant a go when you happen to be in the Old Quarter in Hanoi.  The Wise-Ones April 2019"

Great ambience with soft lighting and attentive staff. It offers a variety of choices from both local Vietnamese and European dishes. There are set menus with 3 or 5 courses in Vietnamese or European food all at reasonable prices.  We had opted for a 5 courses Vietnamese meal which was delicious and very filling indeed. We had spring rolls, mango salad, soups, hot stone beef stew, fried chicken and fresh fruits.  We also had lunch on two occasions which were equally good and we have lighter dishes from the menu.  Service was excellant and staff were attentive. Food was well presented and delicious.  Dinner service is very busy and we recommend that you make a reservation with the hotel to avoid any disappointment.  Do drop in the Gourment Corner restaurant for lovely food and service.

Very good value, just under $13 for x2 drinks and x2 mains.  We sat on the roof terrace and watched the sunset. Staff were super friendly and smiley and the service topped off the evening. The only very slight improvement is maybe take the empty plates away a bit sooner. I think it was out of the staff's politeness and they didn't want to interupt because just a quick glance over and you could catch their attention. Very attentive and I would recommend this restaurant."

At the conclusion of the meeting, we moved to dinner. The service staff was excellent, always stopping by and seeing how we're doing. The food was great as well as the presentation of the food. And the restaurant was clean and had a great feel to it. There were two sides to the restaurant, and even though we rented out part of it, the other side was still able to sit about 10-12 tables. It's also at a great \"and active\" location so you can get a true feeling on NYC as you enjoy your dinner."

Cold wind blows in from the door because there is no vestibule.  Food was good, not great. Good list of French wines.  We started with charcuterie and cheese plate. About on par with Boar's Head cold cuts and supermarket cheese-counter cheese. Nothing special, nothing especially French and pricey at $31.  I ordered the lamb. After 30 minutes of waiting, the waiter came back and said \"we're out of lamb.\" Huh? After 30 minutes? Anyway, I ordered the cheeseburger which was made with short-rib meat and was tasty. But nothing French about it at all.  We then ordered dessert: Tarte tatin (apple pie of the south of France), classically served with vanilla ice cream. The waiter came back, this time after 15 minutes, and said they're out of vanilla ice cream. Again, Huh? He offered to serve it with chocolate ice cream. Well, both the pie and the ice cream were fine.  So... OK food but not special. Inept service. Unappealing, loud room. Expensive for what it is.  We won't be back.  The next day we went a fabulous Fench Bistro called Le Parisien in the East 30's. This is what Dominique should aspire to be."

Quiet atmosphere set in simple surrounds just a short walk from Lucky Mall. Ideal for breakfast and a slow start to the day. The pastry school equips and trains young women with skills to cook quality cakes and pastry. My daughter loved the banana and ginger cake ! The cafe is up a narrow lane way that is easy to miss, but is signed."

Cha Yam Bai is served in a towering beautiful bird cage of sweet & savoury bites. There is a fine collection of gourmet sandwiches, scones with jam & clotted cream and array of decorative desserts followed by tea & coffee. The cost of this experience was THB 15000++ thoroughly worth every cent, to spend the afternoon of classic indulgence. Enjoyed immensely relishing in the peaceful surrounding.

Prices are reasonable and service was excellent with a great atmosphere. We even had a game of shuffle board. Will definitely be back."

Each time our dinner was cooked to perfection by the lady chef and her colleagues. Staff are attentive but not intrusive. In fact they enhance the experience with their relaxed and friendly manner.  To the food. In a word amazing! From the amuse bouche, the appetisers, the main courses and ending with an imaginative dessert, all were of the highest quality. Our personnel favourites - the beef tenderloin, the lamb chops and the sea bass both cooked on salt blocks - were cooked to the highest standard and were mouth-wateringly good.  If you stay at the Anantara please visit this excellent restaurant."

I am an Argentine living in the U.S., so I know! We were in Buenos Aires for a week and despite the countless restaurants in the Palermo area, we just had to go back to this restaurant twice.  Try the classic \"provoleta\" as a starter. It is an Argentine staple, as is the chicken milanesa as a main course. For those who like something sweet and new, try their mashed sweet potatoes. They are not the same root vegetable as eaten in the U.S. It's sweeter and more fragrant. The dulce de leche pancakes for dessert are a great way to end a fabulous meal. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!"

            "review": "Last year we visited the area and ended up at another well known burger shack. Later that day we stumbled upon Bill's. It looked so appealing and smelled heavenly from the sidewalk. I made a mental note & planned on visiting on our next trip to NYC for the holidays. Fast forward 1 year and here we are at Bill's Bar & Burger!  Upon arrival, we walked inside and found the place pretty packed. We were asked IF we had made reservations and the answer was \"no\". So, we were expecting the worst. However, we were told to head on down the steps and meet the hostess at the bottom of the stairs to be seated. At the bottom, no one was waiting for us. So we approached the hostess stand and got in line there. We explained that we had been sent down from upstairs. After a few minutes we were seated at a HIGH top and given menus. I was a little concerned about the HIGH seats since we had 2 small children in our party, but there were no other seats available at the time. A waiter was around and said he would be with us shortly. We waited and waited and waited. Finally, we see the waiter ask someone else to wait on us. It seemed like chaos.  We ordered 2 burgers and a basket of the sweet potato waffle fries. We also ordered a kids hotdog, which is a foot long! It came with a side of regular french fries and a kids beverage for $10. A regular burger runs around $13 and does NOT come with any sides. Add bacon for an upcharge.  It took about 35 minutes from the time we walked through the door to the time our food was arriving at the table. Everything looked amazing. Burgers were plump, juicy and oh so flavorful. Delish! Bacon was amazing. Regular fries were very tasty, crispy on the outside yet fluffy on the inside. Sweet potato waffle fries were disappointing. They had great flavor but were thin and turned out oh so crunchy and crispy. We asked for a new basket that was not overcooked. Well, we ended up with a second batch of crunchy fries.  Overall, we had a really good meal at Bills Burger & Bar. The burgers were really good. The kids enjoyed the hot dog & so did we since we had to help eat the foot long dogs. Regular fries were good, although they are probably frozen and not fresh cut. Sweet potato waffle fries were a miss. Prices were a tad high, but we expect that in NYC near Rockefeller Center. Dining room area was OK. It felt cramped and I was NOT crazy about the high top tables (for kids or adults). Downstairs seating felt like a basement, where as the upstairs was little more airy with a bar-pub overtone. Restrooms were clean, but one of the toilets kept leaking water on the floor. Staff was friendly. Service is a tad on the SLOW side. So, do not go if in a hurry. I would recommend. I will be back, but next time I will make reservations in hopes of getting a booth or regular table instead.  Bottom Line: Excellent burgers. Well worth a visit if in the area. Would recommend and will most likely be back next Christmas!"

Expensive by Balinese standards but outstanding in every way. Outstanding kitchen, service, management, ambiance and set up. Service was top notch and dessert were large but first class as well. Overall an outstanding experience and a new experience for us after may visits to Bali. If you can afford at least $100AUD a head to get the best steak ever, it\u2019s worth the effort. Highly recommend."

            "review": "The food and decor at this place are excellent, with live musicians in the front room. This place is a little gem. It\u2019s very unfortunate that it is hard to find and if you are not accompanied by a guide or a local, you are followed by a mob of very aggressive teenagers who harass and threaten you until you give them money. We had a staff member from the restaurant standing a couple of meters this happened who just watched and did nothing to help. This is frankly appalling from the restaurant staff. The restaurant knows full well that the mob outside is vile and aggressive and they know the place is very hard to find on your own, but they didn\u2019t offer to come pick us up from our Riad or anything when we called to book a table. It\u2019s only when we complained on arrival that they offered that one of the waiters walked us back to our Riad after the meal. We give 1 star just because of this incident. Moroccan police don\u2019t seem to care about these sort of things and the restaurant turns a blind eye. We will never return and we advise people to go either with a taxi or accompanied by a local for safety."

Our Tom Yum arrived and it was large and very good. The Coconut Prawns we ordered had not arrived and this was also followed up. She said this wasn\u2019t ordered? My wife and I heard the order made.  So the order taking left a lot to be desired.  We finished off with fried banana and ice cream which was a huge serve."

Crispy, chewy crust, slightly wet center, fresh tomato sauce and cheese. You can't go wrong at Sottacasa. The wine list is short but affordable with a number of drinkable options. The backyard space is terrific on a warm night and the whole place seems to glow with warmth on cold evenings. Highly recommended after ten plus visits.."

That being said, the food was delicious. We sat in an enclosed courtyard, and it was a lovely setting.  TIP: they may ask if you want to go to the rooftop for a drink. If it's cold, the entire thing is tented up, so you see absolutely nothing, i.e. no view of anything. It's quite a few steps to get there, so if you are not inclined to do some random exercise, skip this."

All staff spoke impeccable English and were professional and friendly. We ordered a Czech wine, recommended by our server which was excellent, and had a mixture of starters including the gem salad and shrimps. All portion sizes were more than enough for one person. For the mains again a selection of the ribeye steak, Czech 7 hour duck and Octopus. All meals were cooked to perfection. The price was also very good for the level of restaurant. Overall I cannot fault it. It was an amazing experience and we would definitely return. Thank you to all the staff for making it such a great evening, especially with the birthday surprise for my sister in law"

The only option is a pre-determined tasting menu, with the chef asking about any food allergies or dislikes when the reservation is secured. Our meal included 7 or 8 courses, with 3 of fish. The food was meticulously prepared and beautifully presented, but more importantly, many of the courses qualified as sublime. There were no misses. The price is beyond reasonable. They have an amazing selection of gins from France. We tried several G&Ts to start and loved the more floral one."

He brought my drinks and food quickly and attended to me all evening until the bar shut.  On this point, it shut early, with last orders around 18.45 and most of the bar packed away by 20.00, on this week day Monday.  There were families around me who, it seemed, were looked after and it is an easy walk back to the west wing of the hotel.  You can just about see the fountains from here, and the view of the hotel through the palms is amazing.  Certainly take a little stroll out here."

The food is ok, nothing to fave about and there are much better options for steak in s similar area. The pasta was fine but again nothing to special. Staff are friendly and welcoming although our waiter didn't speak English he was very accomodating with us and our limited Spanish. It's nice for a quick cheap dinner however would say the nice service outweighs the quality of the food."

So many amazing flavours and the chef has clearly put a lot of thought into how the dishes all go together.  Not only is it delicious, but it is greatvalue for money. \u00a320pp gets you the grande selection - a tapas-style offering of nearly everything on the menu. It's more food than we could eat (and boy did we try!). Favourite dishes included the cashew cheeze, the homemade pakoras and the two curry dishes.  You get free top ups of any dish you want (we couldn't manage that) and they give you doggy bags to take away your left overs. The vegan brownie we had for dessert was TO DIE FOR. Oh how can it be so rich and crispy and gooey all at once, and accompanied by delicious vegan ice cream.  You bring your own booze but we also tried the delicious complimentary tea at the end. They were also kind enough to give us little pots of the tea mix to try at home!  The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, with everyone cooing when their selections arrived, and the staff were incredibly lovely and helpful.  This is a gem in Earlsfield and I'll definitely be back, bringing friends (veggies and non-veggies alike) so that we can feast again!!"

            "review": "My husband invited me to Pur' to celebrate our first anniversary :) The whole experience was delightful from start to finish. We went for the 6-course dinner, which is very generous if you also count the beautiful amuse-bouche sent by the chef (we started with a foie gras lollipop which was divine!!). The bread and wine selection are exquisite, (a wine is associated with every dish), the service is outstanding and the food is mouthwatering. Every course was a beautiful surprise for our palates, and, for the cherry on the top, we met the chef before leaving and he gave us little cookies to take home and eat the next day. I will definitely be back on my next visit to Paris!"

The ambience is warm and relaxed, and the service we received was attentive and courteous at all times, from everyone. We took a la carte (rather than a tasting menu) - crab starters, monkfish for my wife and duck for me. All excellent, and my wife's avoidance of gluten and lactose was dealt with as no problem at all. Worth its star, and worth a visit. We'll go back."

The view here is stunning, overlooking pretty much all of Istanbul - panoramic views! We hadn't booked, but got a table on the terrace looking out over hagia Sophia museum. Waiters were efficient but took time to take our order as were having pictures taken with a group of Australian ladies! The food was good, we both had lamb and it was cooked really well , but nothing spectacular in terms of service or presentation of the food. We also tried a mojito - probably one of the worst I've tasted! I'd recommend for the views alone!"

The prices are not cheap, but the food quality is outstanding, so one leaves highly satisfied. We are not cocktail fans, but this is clearly a major attraction of this restaurant, indeed many people apparently come here just to drink them. The couple at the table adjacent spent several minutes photographing their cocktails before drinking them!"

Lovely location and set up, lovely staff, Luis is super friendly. My one fault that didn't give the night an 'excellent' rating was that the steak wasn't as juicy and succulent as others I've had which was disappointing for us. But a great night nonetheless :)"

            "review": "We first went to their restaurant on Spring Street, which is very small & extremely noisy, so noisy we left and went around the corner to their, mainly, fish restaurant. I had the spagetti Nero with Langoustines and zucchini flowers. The sauce was lacking in flavour and was very peppery. They must have run out of zucchini flowers (already at 1:30pm) because there were none. My wife had the wild boar meatballs with porcini mushrooms and truffles. Both meals were okay, but not top notch Italian/Sicilian. They have very few Sicilian wines, and a lot of Tuscan / Piedmontese, which is probably understandable in the US. Sicily does have a lot of great wine producers so perhaps they aren't available here. They did have one Planeta rose, which is good, but for a popular choice Plumbago would be good. Work needs to be done in the kitchen & on the wine list, then perhaps they will live up to the name they created."

The cocktails and whisky to finish the evening just added to the festivities."

Live piano music in the background, tables spaced out nicely to make you feel Covid safe and comfortable and beautifully presented. All staff wore masks. The food and selection of teas and jams were outstanding. Really recommend trying rose petal jam and wild cherry tea. Altay, our waiter, was very attentive and helpful.  If you want to pamper yourself or a loved one then this is the place to go."

Truly the best ever Moussaka I've had. Add in an imported beer and the tab came in. in the low 30's. Highly recommended."

I had the Papri Chat, a dish that I had never had before. It was so good that I actually ordered another to take home for later.

But my dish, the Filetto 68Q al Gorgonzola (photo below) was very tasty and also I won't forget the Panna Cotta dessert I tasted at Come Prime, one of the best.

The food was contemporary with a local Khmer touch. After quite some nights previously of enjoying a host of Cambodian dinners and meals, which we loved by the way, we chose this evening to opt for some Australian and Cambodian steaks which were cooked to perfection! The food was reasonably priced, as were the drinks. Thoroughly recommend and a memorable evening"

My wife and I were seated in the back of the restaurant right up against the dessert tray! We both started with a Manhattan.Turned out to be the best thing of the night. Shared a caesar salad that had this \"Sweet\" strange dressing.Not a hint of an anchovy. Our waiter recommended a pasta(I can't remember the name) that was watery, not much flavor. We each had a glass of the Super Tuscan wine that didn't have much going for it either. I guess our photo, won't be up on the wall...."

It looks run down ( as does the area) but don't go by appearances. we were surprised by the quality of the food and coffee. It just goes to show that even though a place looks tatty it can excel in food and service. Give it a try! You will be pleasantly surprised."

The service was pleasant, but regular. Prices more of a standard. Good place for families with children as you can sit outside also."

Just a shame you don\u2019t get the suntan with it But you certainly get the best cocktails and the best value for money for the service,food and drink OUTSTANDING  The \u00c0 la carte menu has an abundance of good choices they really get the taste buds going and the wine pairings really finish off the dishes to bring out the best . I don\u2019t think you would find any high end restaurant in London that have a really really good core TEAM of people as they do here keep up the good work your all amazing."

Good menus; one Italian, one Marrakech. Wine menu starting at 26,000DH so over \u00a322 a bottle.  Highly recommend the lemon tart."

The menu changes regularly to make the best use of fresh ingredients, and the service by Laurie was impeccable. She was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the wine matching options, and the food we sampled based on her recommendation was without fault. In particular, the prosciutto was mouth watering and the panna cotta a delight!"

Told the waiter, he acknowledged this and then just walked around the place as if he had forgotten what we just said - 10 minutes passed until he got back with the second beer... We had ordered sweet potato fries, but got classic fries. The burgers were good, nothing spectacular, and the South of the Burger completely fell apart following the first bite. Prices are good and the place has a nice vibe to it."

Set on a busy street it\u2019s easy to walk past - but don\u2019t! The food is very tasty and the owner -Pal - very friendly. We like spicy food but he even offered to let us try the different degrees of change to the food which was very impressive. Great flavours and super value - \u00a335 - \u20ac42 for a starter and main each with a couple of beers each. Be warned the portions are very generous. Service was a little manic but we will definitely return"

The pickup service failure- they had to be reminded to pick us up after we had been waiting for 30 minutes- this is even after we had sent an email booking(not answered) plus a confirmation call from our hotel reception earlier in the day  Setting was nice and service was friendly - but hard to see who was learning and who was coaching - recently in Laos we went to one where they had T-shirts to show who did what  Unfortunately for the prices charged (high by Cambodian standards) they failed to deliver - especially the $10 prawns and red curry sauce - the 6 very small prawns were soft like crawfish (very disappointing), the red curry sauce was nice but we could of done with some more, red rice was also ok but to call this plate a main is a joke - 6 mouthfuls and it was all over!  We did like the complimentary spring rolls and the mango and sticky rice ($4) was a good rendition of an Asian classic.  We did have a bottle of Italian Pinot Grigio which was unexpectedly very dry and a nice bottle of French Chardonnay both of which were priced at around the $22 mark - not sure who was meant to be coaching the lovely young lady to get the cork out but together we got there in the end  Large Angkor beers around $4 each  Plus a small thing that\u2019s annoying is not showing the fully inclusive prices........"

The food is crazy cheap even by Cambodian standards while the portions are plentiful. Fish amok especially recommended, while the healthy and versatile juices/ shakes/smoothies were very nice too."

On entering the restaurant I had no idea what was behind the facade, which looks pretty ordinary, and said I wanted to eat inside. The waiter politely sugggested outside would be better and led me around the side of the building. I was really amazed, they have unique swing-mattress, bed like tables (though you can choose a normal table if you want) that make you feel like it is a high end restaurant in Marrakech (the last time I saw anything like this). So we were super comfortable and our toddler was in her element. The food was also great, the drinks wonderful and the prices, even with the 10% added at the end, crazy low given the ambience and environment. We will be back!"

I dont think of all the place where ive had food they serve as good at this  Other things to definitely try is the papdi chaat. Really tasty.  Zaitooni salad is also a must try.  In curries, my top spot goes to the chicken tikka masala.  Their butter chicken is good too for those who cant have spicy food.  In veg, i prefer their aloo gobi adraki, very nice amd savory.  And highly recommended are their yellow dal tadka or the dal makhano. Both are very good.  Their briyani would be the best in town in terms of taste and serving. Either one, You cannot go wrong in briyani at gazebo.  Until next time  Bon Appetit"

Providing an 18 course tasting menu (with an optional wine pairing selection) this small venue (less an 20 tables) provides an intimate evening serving seasonal and delicious local food.  Service is friendly and attentive. All dishes are clearly explained and are uniquely presented. A great place for a \u2018highlight\u2019 meal. Try to enjoy this place before it moves to the more upmarket Recoleta area in March 2019.  Dinner takes about 2 hours. Sit back, relax and enjoy a wonderful taste experience."

There was endless tea and sandwiches, with the most delicious scones Ive ever had, the selection of cakes was exceptional! Of you are planning on enjoying afternoon tea here make sure you arrive hungry! The Park Room itself is stunning such beautiful surroundings for an indulgent experience and we loved the added extra of the pianist playing in the background. Would definitely visit again for a special occasion."

We accompanied this with a starter to share, some sides and a bottle of wine and some water!  Food - was very good. You would expect this from a 5* hotel but the steak was exceptionally cooked and the risotto very tasty although slightly creamy. Wine was very good and matched our food - overall a great evening.  We paid roughly \u00a395 which although I expected from a 5* hotel is very excessive and I think too pricey. I was personally expecting to pay more \u00a370 however a good night, great food and good service - would recommend!"

We arrived at the restaurant just before 8 pm - a locked door with no signage or indication of what was to follow. We were handed a glass of sparkling white wine and met our fellow diners and set out on a gastronomic journey over the next three hours. A five course meal with exquisite wine pairings from, where else, but Mendoza. There is only one sitting, with a maximum of 8 guests all sharing stories and great food cooked, or grilled, to perfection. This was a dining experience, not just a meal."

I opted for the 6 course degustation. 3 amuse bousche came first and they were ok. The 1st course was white asparagus. Not a big fan, but it was ok. Seabass followed and it was good and well coordinated with all the other elements. Veal was the main and it was very good. A heavy melted cheese course followed. It was ok but too heavy and cheesy to finish. The strawberry and chocolate desserts finished the set and they were great. Petit fours were also too much for me by then  Service is very good as expected  Pur-fect"

Evidently not an \"IT\" restaurant in paris. I was here 7 -830pm on a friday night and the place was only 20% full. I also felt overdressed wearing a suit with bow tie  Had the award winning duck pate and it was good. The pigeon was commendable too, and traditionally presented. I prefer the pigeon i had at Le Mesure a few days ago  Service was good but i had such a great time with the staff at Le Gabriel earlier during lunch this pales slightly"

Always a pleasure to visit for a business meeting or for a dinner with my beloved. We really enjoyed the time spent and we simply loved the food! I highly recommend the dill soup and you HAVE TO try the chocolate dessert with amarena!"

However, there were several things that affected our experience. First, one of the hostesses kept spraying an awful air freshener. It reminded me of being on an airplane in certain countries when they disinfect the plane. Horrible! My husband later learned that they were using it to camouflage a sewage problem they were experiencing in the men\u2019s room. Our waiter started out great, but we never saw him after placing our order as he was then moved to serve a large party. Consequently we never had service again. We had to wait 40 minutes to get our check. A hostess noticed my dissatisfaction when leaving and asked if everything was okay. When I explained about the service, she just said they were busy. I think there are better restaurants to spend your money in than Cabernet."

We were told there would be a delay in our food arriving which was fine, we had time so made the choice to stay. Had a couple of really lovely cocktails and the OH had a large beer and an aperitif. We actually received our food pretty quickly and were so glad we decided to stay and wait. I had the Caesar burger, a patty with lettuce, croutons, Parmesan and delicious Caesar dressing. Hubby had bacon, cheese, rocket and caramelised onions with his. Both were absolutely delicious. Decent portion of good fries on the side. Really reasonably priced considering what we had and the quality. This place is a little off the beaten track although still really central. But it\u2019s not somewhere you\u2019d necessarily walk past on a tourist route. Search it out, I heartily recommend it. One of the best burgers I\u2019ve had for a long long time."

A distinguished Australian man (one of the volunteer) explained us the mission of this amazing non-government organisation, focusing on providing free education, health care and community development service to the people of Mondul Bai. So do not esitate: join New Hope Cambodia Restaurant for a meal and you will never regret it."

And trust me the kitchen he has to work in - is tiny! So I am sure it was a challenge.  I enjoyed the wine, the meal and the discussion."

With choosing Pur' we definitely made the right choice. The restaurant itself is beautiful, but beyond that the service was very warm, welcoming and knowledgeable and the food itself was excellent. The presentations for the plates were really pretty and only outdone by how good the dished tasted."

            "review": "We had read some of the reviews and some were not so favorable so we went with a little trepidation. No need to be concerned at all and possibly in 6 weeks of travelling this was certainly one of the best experiences we had at a mid range price. Firstly the chef, the host and the server, were extremely warm and friendly people who could not do enough for you to make this a really exceptional experience. I can't possibly remember each course and they did come quickly although at the right time, other reviews said they felt rushed, this was not our experience at all and we found that each course was paced perfectly. I ate things I had never eaten before and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. As always there are a few things that could make the experience one notch higher. The restaurant is small and it was hot, we suggest LED bulbs and the owner did turn the lights down a little later in the evening. It is also a little noisy when you get that person who wants to tell everyone their news. Because the restaurant has hard surfaces, brick wall, high ceilings the noise bounces, so some soft sound absorbent panels hung from the ceiling horizontally might help with that. I hope this restaurant survives, it is a tough market but we thought they were doing everything right and I would definitely return next time I am in Paris."

There are only 24 seats, mostly on the mezzanine area. It appears basic but noticeably clean and tidy. The menu is a blend of Moroccan and international with everything from pizzas, pastas, burgers, salads, traditional Moroccan, crepes, soups. I enjoyed a really good home made courgette and vegetable soup followed by spaghetti bolognese and fruit salad and mint tea (served with complimentary Moroccan biscuits/pastries). As it got busier there was pressure on the speed of service - but I was in no hurry - but all through there was a pride and passion for what was being served and how it was presented. Very inexpensive, an extensive menu and caring service made this place instantly likeable. Good on ya Yassine!"

We got there about 7pm and were told by members of the queue that they were told they were the last to be served. Being British we ignored the warnings and joined the queues. Luckily they managed to squeeze us in and we had the best meal we had eaten in our two week trip. It was amazing value and we paid a chunk more than the bill came to as we felt that it was worth it. We even brought a few drinks to take back to the hotel with us. The spring rolls are fantastic. Also they were great for vegetarians as my husband is one. Just wished we had discovered this place on night one in Siem Reap as we'd have been back every night. Thank you to the staff and cooks at Tevy's Place."

We had really excellent steak here - we both had the bife de chorizo and the meat was among the nicest I have ever had at reasonable prices given the quality. The salad and fries and Malbec were very good too.  I would recommend booking this place and highly recommend the meat. There are plenty of other dishes beyond the steak including other meats and pasta too. It deserves the positive reviews it gets. Service was friendly with some English spoken and it\u2019s a nice traditional style parrilla restaurant.  The locals on either side of us shared steaks rather than take one of their own. The bife de chorizo steaks are big enough for two to share. Apart from cutting the cost down it also leaves room for starters and/or desserts - that\u2019s an option worth considering."

We came to this Sea.Fire.Salt Seafood restaurant and decided we just eat here, that was the best decision the day.  We were impressed with how elaborated the Salt can be with every dish during our dinner. The staff appeared to know their Salts very well too. The recommended type of Salt for us tasted just great with our food.  We had a table indoor because it was raining. Ambiance was great. Food was great.  Service was prompt and attentive."

Was a buggy ride away from the hotel room.  The view from the restaurant was great. Good before the sunset so that you can enjoy both the sunset and the night view.  Alfresco dining is recommended because you will have the unblocked view to the sea and the pool. But get ready your insect repellent and embrace the heat because the fans weren't helping much.  We ordered a set menu for 2 pax. Was decent but nothing exceptional. The pace of serving was a little too lengthy, we actually got bored waiting for food after a while. We got seated by 6 pm and we left the restaurant at 8.30 pm.  Would I recommend this to anyone? If you are staying at the resort, why not because you don't have much choices there.  If you are making a trip here from elsewhere, I don't think you miss much."

The place is small and we got there on a Friday night around 6, but managed to come just in time. The kitchen is open to the diners so you hear the hustle and bustle. Our waitress was very nice. We got the meatballs and soppressata for appetizers. The meatballs were delicious and my gf said they were just as good as her grandmas homemade Sicilian meatballs and that's saying something! The pizza had olives and sausage on it. The crust was nice and thin, but if there's one complaint it would be the crust was a little burnt in spots. Other than that a delicious dinner!"

It is closed on Wednesday. There were two small tables on the ground floor with the main open kitchen behind them. On the first floor there were10 small tables for 4 people each.  Be prepared to wait a while as the food is freshly prepared. It is worth the wait as the food is delicious. I have been there on two occasions and on both time there was only one waitress who spoke very good English and was rushed off her feet. The local dish which I chose called Tajine was lovely. I chose a Tajine chicken which had fresh vegetables - runner beans, potatoes, carrots, olives (photo enclosed). This was my first Moroccan dish and I was not disappointed.  On the second time I had a freshly made pizza and it was just as enjoyable as the traditional Moroccan dish. Everything on it was fresh and it tasted wonderful. It tasted better than the ones that I had in Rome and Sicily.  This little restaurant gets very busy. I would highly recommend going early as possible otherwise there can be an hour waiting time. Diners do seem to be in a hurry to leave.  You will not be disappointed as it is a great place to enjoy home cooking at a very reasonable price."

The waiter was friendly in a French kind of way, ok for us but can get annoying.  We were recommended some dishes and despite the quality of the ingredients, the flavors just didn't work out well together. The crab starter has a horrible gelatin and the fish eggs didn't taste anything. My main dish was ok (slow roasted meat) but the fish had a very strong sauce. The \"light\" deserted was e regular mango mousse, not good or bad.  At almost 50EUR a head I would expect much more for a neighborhood small restaurant. I personally had much better meals in Paris, with also well chosen ingredients and much better execution.  If you like strong dishes and are in the neighborhood there is no harm in trying, for us it wasn't a smart choice."

It is tucked away between shops on a bustling street This place is very popular so booking is recommended as the Restaurant is not very big about 20 covers ,but is very plush and ideal for a romantic dinner .Large windows offer picturesque views of Hanoi with a rooftop bar on the 13th Floor which is not enclosed We had a table in the corner and the menus were provided .The menu is mostly Vietnamese food and there is an accompanying wine menu We choose Pumpkin Soup and Scallops for Starters followed by Chicken and Cashew Nuts and Steamed Sea bass in Banana leaf .Food presentation was superb. Prices not to expensive to Westners it was 1.397.550 dong that included a 5% service charge and 10% tax. Overall enjoyable meal with a great selection of dishes to choose from"

The restaurant is small so reservations are necessary as it gets busy. The staff are friendly and welcoming and the view is lovely over the water. The menu has some Thai traditional dishes but also some not so well known ones and the Grouper with three sauces is our favourite. It comes filleted and has amazing flavours. We ate here twice and if we were here another day we would have been back for a third day. Definitely one of the highlights of staying at this hotel. Do not miss it!"

The buffet selection was amazing and was constantly kept stocked up and freshly cooked. The staff were happy to make recommendations and to cook special requests such as noodle. The quality oft he food is excellent. The buffet meals at there Marriott Cafe are well worth a visit but be careful as during low season they are few and far between. They have different themes and in my experience they are all great value. Good for families and they always have child friendly dishes available."

My friend had the Lok Lak Beef, which tasted really good as well, savoury and peppery sauce covered the tender beef slices. The ice lime tea was very refreshing in the humid weather. Owner was also very friendly. Would come back again whenever I\u2019m in Siem reap!"

Our meals of duck variation and veal fillet looked small but we're filling. The flavours were wonderful. Dessert was just as good. White chocolate mousse was a little dense and pistachio panda cotta was a little loose but tastes great. My wife had the dessert sampler, creme brulee, chocolate mousse and raspberry sorbet which she said ticked all the boxes. The praline and macaron petit fours rounded the meal off nicely. This is not my usual type of restaurant and way above what i normally pay but i didn't feel conned by the price and felt the whole experience was worth the money."

I had some great expectations and i wasn't disappointed. The full menu was straight to the point...Hight quality products, seasoning, cooking, design, service and wine pairing. I will not describe all the courses...but I would just say that it was a pleasure to have some Asian twinkling... The fact to be in a open kitchen concept and in a rotunda restaurant give a very warm atmosphere to the place. J.Francois Rouquette is the \"Chef d'Orchestre\" and the symphony is perfectly achieved... I hope those lines will drive you to this fantastic place and that you will have the chance, as me, to see the stars in the eyes of your partner. Thanks to this great team."

                        "review": "I visited twice in December, once by myself for lunch and again for lunch with hubby.  The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.  The points above wouldn\u2019t stop me from visiting again but there\u2019s room for improvement."

I found out about the business lunch menu from other TA reviews.

The service was good without being overbearing and the staff checked with us if the food was ok.  They have a good selection of Khmer and Western food as well as juices and coffees. 2 mains and a green juice set us back $11.50 which I think was reasonable given the portion size and quality of the food. I would like to visit again, it\u2019s just a shame it\u2019s not open later on in the evening."

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."

The sirloin in red wine reduction was superb, and the waiters coped very well with our complete lack of Spanish, and request for a gluten free meal. The wine choice was spot on and the service generous, professional and warm. Seating options are inside, or a lovely covered adjoining courtyard facing a fabulous lovely street."

            "review": "The closed-door restaurant was a foreign concept to us and sounded intriguing when I saw it on TripAdvisor. There were two other couples who joined us so it was interesting meeting new people. We were at the end of our two week trip in northern Patagonia so had tried nearly everything already somewhere else along our journey. But it was nice to have a great variety of offerings all at once between the charcuterie tray, meat appetizers, provoleta, main beef dish, and dessert. The dessert was something new and very tasty. Our provoleta was overcooked and drier than all the others we had eaten over our two weeks in region. The commentary Luis provided was professional and educational and it was nice to be able to go watch the cooking in action. I would recommend the experience to first-timers to BA."

The decor is very tastefully done, there's perfectly subdued music, the owner always greets his guests personally so you feel instantly at ease and welcome, the staff are professional and friendly and the food is just excellent and miles superior to what most Indian restaurants serve and all at very reasonable prices. If you like Indian food you'll love this place and like me want to return time and again."

            "review": "I will start with the setting, which was lovely. Outside dining with blue and white tones, over looking the ocean (if you are there before sunset). Their online reservation system is VERY broken. We had a reservation for New Year\u2019s Eve (we received an email confirmation) but when we showed up, they had no record of it. They informed us that they were not doing the menu that night and sent us on our way - where are you supposed to find another restaurant at 9 pm on New Year\u2019s Eve? We decided to try again on January 2nd. Again made reservations online...and received an email confirmation. Got to the restaurant and they had no record of the reservation...at least this time they accommodated us. As I said before, a lovely setting. Our waiter had some struggles providing us with accurate menu information (actually was inaccurate on his description of several menu items) and overall the service was fair at best. If you are looking at their menu online - DON\u2019T! It is not the same....and the menu at the restaurant was not descriptive - hard to know what you were going to get. We saw nothing served on a salt block. I am wondering if they have changed management or the menu compared to previous reviews - usually Trip Advisor is a good reflection of a restaurant- but not this time - look only at recent pictures and reviews! Most items were very overpriced! We had Tiger Prawn Cocktail - it was only 2 (two!) prawns and cost 750 Bhat! They were good, but really? We ordered two bottles of wine that were listed in the menu for 1700 bhat and we were charged 2000 bhat per bottle! As for main dishes- the ribeye was fair at best, the scallops were 4 scallops - very tender but otherwise very average...the best dish we had was the blue swimmer crab - 4 crabs, very tasty but a lot of work to eat. The Parmesan mashed potatoes were good, enough for two people. The Lobster Mac and Cheese? Not an accurate description at all...it was more of a pasta in a lobster bisque - no cheese to speak of. We ordered asparagus - sorry, they were out. So, I don\u2019t usually tell people to avoid a restaurant - but we had much better meals and experiences in Phuket- eat elsewhere!"

The restaurant itself is lovely and cosy - there are no sea views from there if you're after that but we went at night so it didn't matter! Definitely recommend."

            "review": "I'm really glad we opted to try Steaks by Luis. We made the reservation about a month in advance of our trip to Buenos Aires, which was a stopover on the way to Ushuaia and our Antarctic expedition. As many reviewers have already mentioned, it's one of those \"closed-door\" restaurants that is in a fashionable loft and only takes place a few times a week. No sign - just a staff member outside to assure you you've found the place! My boyfriend and I actually walked from our hotel to the restaurant (we needed the exercise to help burn off the calories) - about 4.5 miles (7.25 KM)! We made just in time and were welcomed in to find appetizers (cheeses and cured meats) and a sparkling wine. We had some time to mingle and meet the hosts and to view the meats that would be grilled up for our other courses - deliciously beautiful! At a certain time (a little after 9 p.m., I guess) we were instructed to take our seats. We sat down across from an American couple who - it turns out - were heading out on the same Antarctic expedition we were booked on and had posted on a TA forum thread we started! And the couple to my right (from China) were also on the same ship! I would say that pretty much all 20 or so guests were either from English-speaking countries or spoke English so, while you probably won't meet many locals at SbL, you will have plenty of people to talk to! In fact, as in our case, you never know who you might meet! I actually loved the communal dining aspect - it made the time spent at dinner that much more enjoyable.  The food was amazing. We had a salad with cheese and apples along with a nice wine for the second course. The third course was the most interesting: a mixed grill of identifiable sausages and other meats, plus a few that were *mysteries* to some of the diners. They want you to try before you judge because many people avoid certain parts of the cow/pig on principle. Haha. Some of it I liked, some of it I didn't; everyone had an opinion, but most people were game to try all of it. Plus, they served a grilled provolone cheese that was amazing.  The steaks - the main course - were large (12 ounces); I couldn't even finish mine! It came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes that were scrumptious. But I made sure to leave room for the dulce de leche cheesecake, which was both beautiful and heavenly to the palette. Mmmm, mmm! Did I mention we had wine with all these courses? And it just kept magically refilling?  All in all, this is an experience you won't regret and I think it is actually a really great value for the attention and service (and food) that you get. It is a 3+ hour meal during which you will never be bored!"

That was the case on a Saturday night when we visited. Don't expect gushing US style wait staff. The staff, from the greeter to the head waiter were the essence of Indian good manners and correct service. You could have been in the Taj Palace in Mumbai. Pleasant and respectful at all times. The menu is extensive with both traditional and unexpected dishes. We had the crab cakes and bhel puri as appetizers, and Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Xacutti as entrees. All were excellent. Accompanied by a mixed bread basket. The Kingfisher Lager was good too! At 9:30 new groups of diners were still arriving and the majority were either Indian or of Indian decent. That must be a recommendation. We were impressed and enjoyed the meal immensely."

The food is always exceptional and creatively prepared using fresh regional ingredients. Each of 5 courses is described in detail and paired with thoughtfully chosen wines. The chef is incredibly knowledgeable of wines and the stories behind them. His background in some of the best restaurants in New York City offers an interesting perspective. If the food and beverage were not enough, the interactions and friendships made with the guests takes the experience over the top. Everything about the timing and the interactions and the flow of the evening has always seemed to be \u201cjust the right amount of everything\u201c. Bravo! (Get there soon as the chef is technically retired but still doing these special events on occasion.)"

We really enjoyed meeting the other guests but the food was the star of the show. Every dish was attractively presented and absolutely delicious. The portions were perfect if not slightly large but everything was seasoned to perfection. The chef Dan brings vast food knowledge from years of experience, research, and from being a food writer. This is such a special experience that I strongly suggest you book it in advance as to not be disappointed if trying to do so after you arrive in Buenos Aires. When available, Dan also provides food-oriented day tours. We were lucky to spend a full day with him and it enriched our experience immensely as he has lived there for almost 20 years. His Spanish and English are perfect and he speaks several other languages."

They have a new bar area, and an incredible beverage selection  The food was simply out of this world. We all tried two dishes, which were all good. I had veal and my wife ordered lamb. Both great, the meat you could cut with your fork. The desserts look great but after that sumptuous dinner we could not eat any more. The price was justified regarding the quality."

I personally didn't love the space which was quite dark and cramped so I feel this would be more of a winter dining destination (as it is cosy) than a summer one. We would have liked to check out the bar too but did not manage to do that on this occasion. I think, when we dined here previously (many years ago) that we had our meal on the upper level where the bar now is. I was keen to try some cocktails and was told that not all cocktails made in the bar were available in the restaurant and I wasn't sure why but that's ok. I did have 2 very nice cocktails whilst there (pink diamond and a dessert cocktail as I had no room for dessert after the amazing entree and main). Both myself and my husband had the Paua entree which was sublime and we then had mains as follows: Hubby had the beef which was divine and I had the duck which was exquisite. I can't recall the exact side dishes we had but we had 2 and they complemented our mains beautifully. Wine: the wine list was good but not amazing and somewhere as 'exclusive' as The Bunker should have a better selection IMHO."

Having been once before a few years ago with a really diverse group who I thought would be impossible to collectively please (they all loved it) I was keen to revisit Public K&B. On finding they were still open and still receiving great reviews it was a no-brainer and off we went. The atmosphere, food and service were all fabulous...I highly recommend this waterfront restaurant and bar....a great night out guaranteed....bookings recommended even though QTN currently quieter than usual."
