We have booked a table for the family of four. We were late more than 15 min and waited approx 10 mins in the lounge, so not too bad (the restaurant offers 15 min grace period). I won't be much mistaken if i say that from the time of our taking order to the moment the chief came up to our table, an hour has passed. We had starters, but these finished quickly. The chief was lovely, doing his job the best he could. Food was a ok, but i don't think worth the money. As my 12 years old son said: 'yes it was entertaining but there were other places that could fill your stomach much better'. As a food lover i am not satisfied. Are the 3 skinny slices of salmon and thimble of steamed rice worth \u00a330 considering the fact they taste exactly like you would have prepared it yourself at home ? Not sure. Nothing spectacular about grilled chicken or the sea food either. So, Benihana is fair enough as a one off entertaining only experience, because without the food being cooked in front of you it does not have anything extraordinary to offer. And 16% service charge at the top of it ?? All the best to our lovely cook Diego."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/dorah710", "user_id": "dorah710", "user_name": "Dora H", "user_ta_level": 4.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "London, United", "user_nb_contributions": 22.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 14.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 54.0, "user_nb_photos": 14.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Nature Lover;Peace and Quiet Seeker;Family Vacationer"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "7010", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d3318261-Reviews-Shanghai_Asian_Cuisine-New_York_City_New_York.html", "review_date": "June 6, 2019", "review_city": "New York City, United States", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Chinese casual", "review": "Place was tight, and was full even an hour before dinner time.

Soup decent but not at its price tag, dessert was good but spices from the pineapple overpowered the Gelato. Overall food was good and we enjoyed it, but I think for its price it is definitely not worth it. Upon arriving, we Said we had made a reservation but at the desk they did not have it, but luckily it was not busy at 12.

We opted for four sharing starters between the three of us: houmous, calamari, feta & spinach pastry and halloumi. We received free bread with these too. The pastries were delicious! The calamari was top quality, although would have benefitted from a tartare dip. The houmous and halloumi were ok. For mains, my partner and his mum had lamb, which they insisted was some of the best that they had ever tasted. I had chicken souvlaki, which was full of flavour. We received a big bowl of salad to share between us. There was plenty, although some more feta would have been great. We also shared some chips and rice between us. The chips were seasoned to perfection, but desperately required some sauce. I asked for ketchup on two occasions but unfortunately never received any. At the end, we asked for the bill twice, and eventually we received it, followed by some free shots. Overall, the experience was great. I recommend a visit if you are nearby.

Sadly, this was accessed by a very tight spiral staircase, not very suitable for the elderly. Unfortunately, it was pretty full and the service slow. People weren't even served in order. No alcohol, but some nice fruit juices. Decent Moroccan salad starter. The chicken tagine was ok even if the vegetables were overcooked, but the cous cous (also in a tagine) had seriously overcooked, almost unrecognisable, soggy vegetables, and was nearly bereft of its supposed chicken.

The restaurant is staffed throughout by females and, without wishing to sound sexist, I truly believe you can taste and experience their delicate and feminine touch throughout.  My wife and I were privileged to enjoy their seven course, regularly changing, tasting menu and were rewarded with some exceptional, exquisite tastes. Presentation and service were exemplary too.  Combined with a four glass classic wine pairing for me and a four cup tea tasting for my wife, the cost isn't cheap in Siem Reap terms but at $36 per person for food, $29 for four glass of paired wine or $15 for four deliciously flavoured teas, it's incredible value for money given the quality of food, presentation and service on offer.  In addition we were given complementary amuse bouche to start, had opportunity to thank one of the chefs direct and were given a leaving gift of their exquisitely presented, complementary macaroons.  An exceptional experience that I would repeat in a heartbeat, I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly.

We where unsure where to try a 'high end' meal in Hanoi, after being given several inconsistent recommendations by previous visitors or tour guides.  For us, Cloud Nine fitted the bill perfectly and we enjoyed our first visit so much that we chose to return again on our final night in Asia.  Located in the La Siesta H\u00e0ng be Hotel, just below the rooftop bar (both reviewed elsewhere) its central to the Old Quarter but has far reaching views in all directions across the city. The decor is undoubtedly chic, with a hint of French presented with a wonderful Asian style and finesse.  They served a mix of Vietnamese and western food, although we only ate from the Vietnamese menu.  They offer a tasting menu at \u00a317 per head but each night we chose to dine a la carte and spent a little more (approx. \u00a325 excluding drinks) but the food, quality, preparation and presentation was absolutely first class.  What sets this restaurant apart though is the quality of service. Anyone who has traveled in SE Asia will know that, if you pay a little more, the quality of service is consistently good. Here it was truly exceptional.  From the very first moment, restaurant supervisor/ maitre d', Amber, ensures that you're welcomed, relaxed and served to your satisfaction. Not that she should have any concerns, as the staff are all, without exception, attentive and polite.  On both occasions we ate here, our server was Huyen. An absolute delight to deal with, her English was seriously impressive, indeed we found her easier to understand than some of our more heavily accented tour guides! She really exceeded any reasonable expectations of service.  On our return visit we were both treated like long lost friends and we'll take memories such as that away with us.  For the record, over our two visits, we ate the special chef spring rolls, Hanoi deep fried spring rolls, Phu Bo, asparagus and crab meat soup, Tom Yum Kung soup, green mango seafood salad, beef on hot stones and Tiger prawns in coconut. We never made it to dessert! In addition, they serve a complimentary amuse bouche to start and a refreshing drink to close.

The food presentation is outstanding. Each dish is a picture of balance and color. In the tasting menu of countless tiny courses...all of which combined could fit into a medium sandwich with lots of extra bread left over...costs something like $160 without wine or beverage. Some of the morsels are delicious and you can even swallow them like you would a vitamin pill. some of the morsels are very mediocre. Some are served with \"vegetables\" which consist of two edamame peas and two slices of carrot so thin you can see through them (smaller than a dime). For those of us who like Korean food, a Korean \"meal\", this is a travesty. To those of us who are pretentious or want the avant grade experience, it's OK.

What was interesting is that unlike many of the other restaurants we went to during our trip to France, Aspic offered a wine pairing with the meal which was quite nice and added an extra layer to the experience.  Service was overall good but you need to go into this with the right expectation that this is a lean operation. As far as I could tell there was the chef in the kitchen and one waitress for about 12 tables. It didn't feel slow or anything but it wasn't \"high touch\" either.

I got the pork adobado (carne al pastor). Yes they use a trompo-that adds the extra crunch and flavor. This is also garnished with a pineapple strip. I suggest not to get the salsa. This way your flavor comes from the meat. My wife got carne asada. 3 tacos each were plenty to fill us up. $4.50. Carne asada was $4.75. We also had Horchata. Some of the best I ever had. I was spoiled with Mexican food because I lived in Dallas for 10 years. I had a few employees come to NYC and I suggested they go here.

The one next door is called the Charnery Tree and only serves the Khmer version. Sokkhak River, however, also has a French Fusion menu as well as tables inside with air conditioning, whereas Chanery Tree only has tables outside. As it wax another hot day in Siem Reap I opted to eat insid.  The French menu is really a Western menu offering mostly steaks, seafood and pasta main dishes for around $20-25. The Khmer menu is about half that price and looked much more interesting offering local classics like Amok, Lok Lak as well as the temptingly exotic Grilled Stuffed Frog, but as I was feeling less adventurous I opted for the Tonle Sap Steamed Fish ($11.50); Bar fish fillet with garlic, shallot, basil, spring onion, cashew and lime dressing. To drink with lunch I ordered a glass of the Obikwa Chardonnay from South Africa. Like all the red and white wines by the glass this cost $5.80.  The Chardy was nice - quite a lot of body with pear flavours. An easy drinking cheap and cheerful! The Sokkhak is very comfortable and stylish. There are two red and black display cases filled with small potted tropical plants, statues and other knick knacks that subtly divide the space in two, black tiled floors, contemporary local art on the walls, and dark wood sideboards where the settings are kept. I had a table near one of the windows that looked out onto a narrow breezeway filled with ferns that separated the restaurant from its sister property next door.  My main was delivered quickly and was very good. The fish was tasty and soft, and the sauce tart and flavoursome but not so much as to over power the main ingredient. The cashews added a nice crunch to an otherwise soft-mouthed dish. I think I did a good job matching the wine too as this complemented the dish very well.  I'd had the tasting menu at another high end restart just next door called Malis a couple of nights before which I really liked, but a couple of locals said this place was better. Personally I liked them both, but it's hard to compare the diverse tastes and experience of a degustation against a single dish. However based on the one I tried here today I'd have to call it a tie. I'd really like Chanery Tree/Sokkhak to introduce a tasting plate to their menu as there were a lot of things they do that I'd really like to try - starting, of course, with the stuffed frog"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kst01231", "user_id": "kst01231", "user_name": "kst01231", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Frankfurt, Germany", "user_nb_contributions": 115.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 174.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 202.0, "user_nb_photos": 19.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Urban Explorer;History Buff"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "70149", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1223683-d4163776-Reviews-Rim_Nam_Pool_Bar-Mai_Khao_Thalang_District_Phuket.html", "review_date": "December 8, 2019", "review_city": "Phuket, Thailand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Great pool food and staff", "review": "This is the food service for the Rim Nam Pool and Bar at the Marriott\u2019s Phuket Beach Club.

I wasn't keen on one of the wines and Salvatore changed it immediately, without any hesitation.  The food was very good, but, as others have commented, the wine is really the star. A pleasant experience, although it is very intimate so difficult not to overhear others' conversations whilst you are dining.  The hosts are charming, a really friendly couple and both speak excellent English.  A word of warning about finding it: the street it is located on is very long, we nearly made the mistake of walking from our hotel in Palermo Soho, and it doesn't feel like a very safe neighbourhood. Our taxi driver mistook the address so had to drop us two blocks further down the road as it's a one-way street, and we didn't feel very comfortable walking, especially as we managed to miss it altogether at first.

We found this restaurant on last Tue (by luck) and since then, we kept returning to this restaurant on the next 2 days before flying back to London on Friday. We just loved their foods! During our visits, we ordered many different types of foods like dumplings, chicken, pork, noodles, fish...etc. and they were all absolutely delicious! (please see my photos for your references) The foods were cooked to traditional Shanghai style and were faultless. I also noticed that most of the customers were local Chinese and it showed \"this restaurant is where the local goes\". The price was reasonable as well. We ordered about 5 - 6 dishes each time and it costed around $30-37 (including tea and soy bean milk) - which was cheaper than a number of restaurants in China Town. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try the real Shanghai cuisines.

If you are used to American Caesar salad we suggest passing on this, as their version wasn't what we are used to. Take a look at the other salads as they pass by - very large and deconstructed style. They offer half portions.  The decor of this restaurant was great with drawn on plates by past customers covering the walls and small air planes and toy blimps along the ceilings. It was filled with tourists but we didn't find it \"too touristy\".  The wait staff were very lovely and kind, spoke English very well.

To say that the food was great would be a big understatement. Our steaks were the best that we had ever eaten! We are still talking about them and wondering if we'll ever have the chance to eat any that taste that good again. They were grilled and seasoned to perfection... not to mention VERY generous portions. The side dishes were plentiful and delicious as well.  And at the end of the meal, we were surprised by the bill... at how small it was! There were four of us dining and we had four steaks, four side dishes, a bottle of wine, a large bottle of beer and several bottles of water - our bill worked out to about $20 US each! Unbelievable for such a delicious and plentiful meal.  Needless to say we highly recommend this restaurant for an authentic Argentine experience and the best steaks you'll ever eat.

We had been put into a private room away from the main area - which we were glad about as it was extremely loud in the main restaurant. The cocktails list is poor - most sound fairly unappetising and the only few we tried were not great & we wouldn't have ordered a 2nd. One had an ice cube in which was the size of the glass so was an utter rip off for what you receive. Once at the table, we asked for the wine list which was apparently non-existent as the waitress came back & read 7 wines from her notepad (not being able to tell us anything about any of them)! She explained they were between wine lists, however even if this is the case its fairly poor for any restaurant to not be able to manage this smoothly. We opted for the safe option of Prosecco and beers - after our 2nd bottle of Prosecco, none of the rest of the bottles were cold which the waitress seemed pretty embarrassed about. She also managed to spill half a glass over my friend when pouring it out. The food was ok, we ordered starters to share (the prawns were tasty) and each ordered a main with some vegetables to share too. At the point of mains, you are basically paying for the spectacle only as the portions are fairly small & food is fairly bland & overcooked. I had the seafood special & the salmon was the best thing since its such an oily fish it could take the extra cooking. The lobster was unfortunately a bit chewy. The egg fried rice was also very blend. Each person also got a pair of ramekins with a couple of sauces - these were not nice & didn't compliment the fish at all, one being overly mustardy - assumably to go with steak. For the entainment value, its a bit of fun with a group of friends but I wouldn't go here just for the food. It was also very expensive for what it is - our bill was over \u00a3120 per person by the end, which was without desserts & there were a few people driving. I would rather spend that sort of money knowing I'm going to get much better food & service. Unfortunately, we won't be returning and I wouldn't recommend to any food lovers thinking of going."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/sus86london", "user_id": "sus86london", "user_name": "sus86london", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "25-34", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Hertfordshire, United", "user_nb_contributions": 168.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 125.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 166.0, "user_nb_photos": 4.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Peace and Quiet Seeker;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "70172", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d1903734-Reviews-Frog_XVI-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "review_date": "February 13, 2022", "review_city": "Paris, France", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Sports bar", "review": "We walked in during a rugby match not knowing it was a sports bar.

Sure - you can just drink the drinks for theatre and get drunk and fall off your bar stool.  But what we learned over 3 nights is just how much time, energy, intelligence and creativity goes into the formulation of the recipes AND the ingredients that go into them. They make many of their own ingredients, and the processes take a long time and a lot of care and skill.  Now, to the cocktails.  They are unique, fun, beautifully balanced and well worth trying. I won\u2019t say much about them, but if you want to sit at a bar, dressed in a laboratory coat and a safety mask, while a cocktail basically explodes in front of you, this is the place to go!

We have traveled to India and are frequent diners at the small places in Edison, NJ (little India) -- places where you get wow (but definitely NOT atmosphere cheap). Utsav is very convenient to theaters, and has a prix fixe menu. We did a combo of small plates, entrees and dessert. The small plates were both excellent -- traditional samosas and a quinoa potato patty. The mains less so. The menu has a combination of traditional and different, and my husband's Baingan Bharta (eggplant) was enjoyable. I had the Shrimp Goa, which was supposed to come in a coconut sauce. It was basically Shrimp Tikka Masala, and it was overcooked. I mean to the point of tough. I've had that issue in Indian places before, but that is a rookie mistake to be sure. Short on time I did not send it back, but also did not love it. The dessert was again quite good, a traditional kheer but with coconut sorbet in the middle. The entire meal cost $150 for 3 people (tax and tip included -- no alcohol). In Edison it's usually about $65 and we have tons left over.

My birthday happened to fall during our stay and we tried to get a table online but the restaurant was showing as fully booked. We emailed the hotel and they were able to confirm a reservation for us just a few nights before. Imagine our surprise when we showed up for dinner and the wonderful maitre d' escorted us to the Chef's table! We did the 7 course tasting with wine pairing but we couldn't keep track of what number we were on, very quickly. (There were so many extras!) I have some dietary limitations which the chef was able to work around, seemingly easily. With the entire kitchen on show, it was a delightful experience though very intimate at the chef's table. We were already impressed and pleased with every course that came out but when the Wagyu beef course came out- I may have cried some tears of joy because it was perfection in my mouth. I even halted the chef to tell him how amazing it was in the middle of the course. Every pairing was a classic match to the dominant flavors of each dish. The cheese course was just ridiculous. In the sheer quantity and selection. Delicious but that quantity is rough on the stomach of non French diners. The madelines and after dinner pastry they offered to pack up to have the next morning (we were so full!) and we were thankful we did!!! Those madelines were better than any other madeline I had ever had and that snail shell was perfectly executed laminated dough.  We are no strangers to multi course fine dining in NYC.

We were there celebrating my birthday and my partner was able to arrange a bottle of champagne with the owner, which they didn't have on their wine list. Nothing was too much trouble and we had a fantastic day.  One thing to note, the pool isn't heated, but that actually makes for a welcome respite from the hot sunshine. It really is a tranquil environment and a fabulous place to have a relaxing day. If we had known about Manzil La Tortue when we were booking our accommodation, we would have definitely booked to stay there. Highly recommended.

And I don't mean that as an insult -- I'm Korean and love Korean food. But I generally think of plentiful comfort food in a plainly decorated mom and pop restaurant, not haute cuisine. The service was accommodating and helpful. We were there for my husband's birthday, and they presented us with personalized menus that wished him a happy birthday.  We started with an amuse bouche/banchan that included steak tartare, fried oyster, foie gras, and raw fish wrapped in thinly sliced Korean radish. This was unlike any banchan I'd ever had! Although this could have been served at any fine French restaurant, the Korean flavors and influence really came through, especially with the fish. Although recommended that we have 5 dishes each off the regular menu (we opted not to do the tasting menu), we only ordered 3 each, which filled us up. We had the sea urchin for two, bossam (pork belly with dwenjang rice), gom tang (wagyu and pine mushroom soup), crispy red snapper, black cod, and dessert. They also brought another dish for my husband's birthday. If you're afraid of spicy Korean flavors, nothing here was too spicy (or spicy at all), but the Korean flavors were evident in all the dishes. It was really the perfect combination of Korean and French.

Perfect decor and a lovely staff. We\u2019ve had dinner here in the past and it was awesome but some menu items have changed and it\u2019s a \u201cmust do\u201d if in Siem Reap. You won\u2019t find this quality of dining anywhere else. Upon arrival you are guided by a host and taken by elevator to the second floor - the Privileged Floor by Lotus Blanc where Damak Lounge is located. My husband is on a special diet and they saw to his every need. Kanika our host made our first reservation while explaining all the amenities in the area. The restaurant has an extensive wine list as well as cocktails. I had champagne and it was heavenly. There\u2019s no rush, couples and families at tables chatting and celebrating in a low tone. Extremely top shelf. Last year when we were there they had live music but this time a nice selection of soft music playing. I\u2019m writing my review and wishing we were there now! One night we were pretty tired so we ordered and our meal was delivered to our room. It was perfect. If you want something that\u2019s not on the menu, just tell them, and it will happen. Mr. Jacky suggested Damak Lounge along with a couple other places. But Damak Lounge was a home run!

Eventually we found it and the entrance, not easy with all the roadworks in the centre of town at present. That was the only ropey bit of our visit.  We were seated in the garden area which has lovely ambience with hanging plants and great views out of all the windows. Service was good considering they were busy (Labour Day).  I had the lamb skewer - wow what a dish with the lamb chunks hanging from a skewer suspended over the plate. I got the waitress to remove the chunks and the hanging mechanism as I knew I would have an accident with it! The lamb was absolutely delicious, so tender. I would definitely have that again. Our son had the eye fillet and his was also really really good. My husband had the mussels as a main course - the mussels were small but lots of them and he rated it excellent.

Firstly, the food was lovely. My wife and I have pretty similar tastes so we both opted for the ravioli, then shared the wild chicken for two and then had the cheese instead of dessert. All were top quality with a special mention regarding the quality of the chicken; so different to a typical farmed bird. To drink we shared a fabulous bottle of Condrieu Blanc followed by a lovely glass of Burgundy with the cheese.  The surroundings were very pleasant. We sat upstairs. Our table was a little close to the one next door but luckily the rather loud couple left quite swiftly - we're usually the last ones to leave so we weren't in any rush.  What really stood out for us here was the quality of the service. We were looked after from the moment we walked in until our waiter escorted us personally out to our taxi after the meal. When the French get their act together like this they do it better than anyone else.

The welcome and entrance to the restaurant created a great atmosphere and the setting is certainly beautiful.  But, the menu pricing seems designed to push you towards one of the set menus, with a couple available at each of a number of price points. Trying to building your own 3-course meal from the a la carte menu is considerably more expensive. So we went with the set menu and our meals were ok, but the portions were small and you can get better value for money elsewhere. The wine list is limited and very expensive.  The main reason for dining here though is the show, and that was very enjoyable (if a little brief). The thing is, once the show was finished (which was early in the evening) we got the sense that we were meant to leave, as the wait staff stopped attending to tables.  Before that though, we noticed how all of the wait staff, who were certainly very chatty and friendly, were putting a lot of pressure on the patrons to write a glowing Tripadvisor review, before they even left the restaurant! Our waitress was quite insistent that we write a review that mentioned her by name (which I won't do here as I don't want her to get into trouble).  Although we would recommend this restaurant as an option for a night out in Siem Reap, we also don't feel that it should be ranked as highly as it is."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/SmokeyD71", "user_id": "SmokeyD71", "user_name": "SmokeyD71", "user_ta_level": 4.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Brisbane, Australia", "user_nb_contributions": 28.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 66.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 27.0, "user_nb_photos": 6.0, "user_tags": "Family Vacationer"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "70306", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d719852-Reviews-Pur_Jean_Francois_Rouquette-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "review_date": "May 13, 2015", "review_city": "Paris, France", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "An unbeatable evening", "review": "Wow what a dinner!

The restaurant serves a 6-course set meal (no a la carte) and the menu changes monthly. We loved every single course, except for 1 of the main course (of pork, which was a bit dry). But every other course was amazing - full of delicious flavours, fresh ingredients and always a refreshing take on traditional Khmer cuisine, infused with modern cooking techniques. My favourite was the dessert - a fusion of western and Asian flavours - ice cream, and traditional cakes from Asia.  The restaurant is also beautifully furnished and the wait staff were attentive and responsive. At the end of our meal, one of the chefs came out to meet us and was open to our feedback about the pork course. They also gave us a box of 2 macarons each, which were really delicious (note that i'm really particular about macarons).

We where unsure where to try a 'high end' meal in Hanoi, after being given several inconsistent recommendations by previous visitors or tour guides.  For us, Cloud Nine fitted the bill perfectly and we enjoyed our first visit so much that we chose to return again on our final night in Asia.  Located in the La Siesta H\u00e0ng be Hotel, just below the rooftop bar (both reviewed elsewhere) its central to the Old Quarter but has far reaching views in all directions across the city. The decor is undoubtedly chic, with a hint of French presented with a wonderful Asian style and finesse.  They served a mix of Vietnamese and western food, although we only ate from the Vietnamese menu.  They offer a tasting menu at \u00a317 per head but each night we chose to dine a la carte and spent a little more (approx. \u00a325 excluding drinks) but the food, quality, preparation and presentation was absolutely first class.  What sets this restaurant apart though is the quality of service. Anyone who has traveled in SE Asia will know that, if you pay a little more, the quality of service is consistently good. Here it was truly exceptional.  From the very first moment, restaurant supervisor/ maitre d', Amber, ensures that you're welcomed, relaxed and served to your satisfaction. Not that she should have any concerns, as the staff are all, without exception, attentive and polite.  On both occasions we ate here, our server was Huyen. An absolute delight to deal with, her English was seriously impressive, indeed we found her easier to understand than some of our more heavily accented tour guides! She really exceeded any reasonable expectations of service.  On our return visit we were both treated like long lost friends and we'll take memories such as that away with us.  For the record, over our two visits, we ate the special chef spring rolls, Hanoi deep fried spring rolls, Phu Bo, asparagus and crab meat soup, Tom Yum Kung soup, green mango seafood salad, beef on hot stones and Tiger prawns in coconut. We never made it to dessert! In addition, they serve a complimentary amuse bouche to start and a refreshing drink to close.

We are fortunate to have eaten some excellent meals on five continents but this restaurant served us one of top five meals of all time.  The restaurant is staffed throughout by females and, without wishing to sound sexist, I truly believe you can taste and experience their delicate and feminine touch throughout.  My wife and I were privileged to enjoy their seven course, regularly changing, tasting menu and were rewarded with some exceptional, exquisite tastes. Presentation and service were exemplary too.  Combined with a four glass classic wine pairing for me and a four cup tea tasting for my wife, the cost isn't cheap in Siem Reap terms but at $36 per person for food, $29 for four glass of paired wine or $15 for four deliciously flavoured teas, it's incredible value for money given the quality of food, presentation and service on offer.  In addition we were given complementary amuse bouche to start, had opportunity to thank one of the chefs direct and were given a leaving gift of their exquisitely presented, complementary macaroons.  An exceptional experience that I would repeat in a heartbeat, I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly.

We ordered some of the tapas items including duck breast, quesadillas, guacamole, very yummy potatoes, and also a few drinks. The portion sizes are decent for the price, we spent around 60 Euros for a nice selection of food and beverages. The food and atmosphere are not fancy, but the dishes are nicely prepared and the restaurant small and cozy. It felt like we were visiting friends and not a restaurant.  Les Apotres de Pigalle is located within a few minutes walk of the Moulin Rouge, and not a far distance from Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur - very close to the Pigalle Metro stop. There are sex shops and such around but if you go from the Metro and don't wander, you won't be seeing much.  Make reservations ahead, since it is a small restaurant it does fill up easily and quickly. During our first visit, there were two other tables nearby with guests from Florida, which was fun.  Les Apotres de Pigalle gets such great ratings because the food they serve and the atmosphere they create is warm and inviting. Both times for us it was a lovely, low-key dining experience."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/nbodyhome", "user_id": "nbodyhome", "user_name": "nbodyhome", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Orlando, Florida", "user_nb_contributions": 31.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 52.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 144.0, "user_nb_photos": 9.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Like a Local;History Buff"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "70385", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255122-d725999-Reviews-The_Bunker_Restaurant-Queenstown_Otago_Region_South_Island.html", "review_date": "December 27, 2022", "review_city": "Queenstown, New Zealand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Fantastic food provided with care and love", "review": "Really enjoyed a beautiful dinner at the Bunker last night with my wife and friends.

The gravy and potatoes were nice and the lamb was pull apart, melt in your mouth. Do yourself a favour and try this with your friends and family.

My only issue was when we ordered milkshakes. The one was recommended by the waitress and I asked if it was mint or mint with cookies for the GF kid. She said it was just mint, we\u2019ll when it came to the table (food runner) it had cookies as a garnish and cookies in the shake (think mint chocolate cookies and cream. I know. Yummy!). I was concerned and she said \u201cI checked chef said it\u2019s gluten free\u201d so the kid ate a cookie and started annihilating the shake. About halfway into it our waitress comes back profusely apologizing and said wait. It\u2019s not gluten free. I double checked and chef said \u201cthere might be some gluten in the cookies\u201d so she checked the box for the cookies and they were definitely not GF. I don\u2019t blame her, and was very happy she rechecked and questioned the kitchen and came back to us. I was upset at the cook or chef who should understand the difference between \u201ca little bit of gluten in the cookies\u201d and gluten free. When it\u2019s a medical issue and a dietary restriction not due to a fad or a lifestyle choice it\u2019s a serious matter.

There were two other couples who joined us so it was interesting meeting new people. We were at the end of our two week trip in northern Patagonia so had tried nearly everything already somewhere else along our journey. But it was nice to have a great variety of offerings all at once between the charcuterie tray, meat appetizers, provoleta, main beef dish, and dessert. The dessert was something new and very tasty. Our provoleta was overcooked and drier than all the others we had eaten over our two weeks in region. The commentary Luis provided was professional and educational and it was nice to be able to go watch the cooking in action.

The burgers melted in your mouth. Quite honestly, the general consensus was that the burgers were slightly bland for our collective tastes (my father asked them to spice up his burger and that was \"solved\" by sprinkling some spice as opposed to putting it in the meat), but one cannot question the quality of cooking and ingredients.

The restaurant is staffed throughout by females and, without wishing to sound sexist, I truly believe you can taste and experience their delicate and feminine touch throughout.  My wife and I were privileged to enjoy their seven course, regularly changing, tasting menu and were rewarded with some exceptional, exquisite tastes. Presentation and service were exemplary too.  Combined with a four glass classic wine pairing for me and a four cup tea tasting for my wife, the cost isn't cheap in Siem Reap terms but at $36 per person for food, $29 for four glass of paired wine or $15 for four deliciously flavoured teas, it's incredible value for money given the quality of food, presentation and service on offer.  In addition we were given complementary amuse bouche to start, had opportunity to thank one of the chefs direct and were given a leaving gift of their exquisitely presented, complementary macaroons.  An exceptional experience that I would repeat in a heartbeat, I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly.

We where unsure where to try a 'high end' meal in Hanoi, after being given several inconsistent recommendations by previous visitors or tour guides.  For us, Cloud Nine fitted the bill perfectly and we enjoyed our first visit so much that we chose to return again on our final night in Asia.  Located in the La Siesta H\u00e0ng be Hotel, just below the rooftop bar (both reviewed elsewhere) its central to the Old Quarter but has far reaching views in all directions across the city. The decor is undoubtedly chic, with a hint of French presented with a wonderful Asian style and finesse.  They served a mix of Vietnamese and western food, although we only ate from the Vietnamese menu.  They offer a tasting menu at \u00a317 per head but each night we chose to dine a la carte and spent a little more (approx. \u00a325 excluding drinks) but the food, quality, preparation and presentation was absolutely first class.  What sets this restaurant apart though is the quality of service. Anyone who has traveled in SE Asia will know that, if you pay a little more, the quality of service is consistently good. Here it was truly exceptional.  From the very first moment, restaurant supervisor/ maitre d', Amber, ensures that you're welcomed, relaxed and served to your satisfaction. Not that she should have any concerns, as the staff are all, without exception, attentive and polite.  On both occasions we ate here, our server was Huyen. An absolute delight to deal with, her English was seriously impressive, indeed we found her easier to understand than some of our more heavily accented tour guides! She really exceeded any reasonable expectations of service.  On our return visit we were both treated like long lost friends and we'll take memories such as that away with us.  For the record, over our two visits, we ate the special chef spring rolls, Hanoi deep fried spring rolls, Phu Bo, asparagus and crab meat soup, Tom Yum Kung soup, green mango seafood salad, beef on hot stones and Tiger prawns in coconut. We never made it to dessert! In addition, they serve a complimentary amuse bouche to start and a refreshing drink to close.  A truly wonderful experience and I would highly recommend."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 5.0}}]}}, {"id": "70440", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g608492-d12971677-Reviews-The_Kelusa_at_Samsara_Ubud-Payangan_Gianyar_Regency_Bali.html", "review_date": "May 16, 2018", "review_city": "Bali, Indonesia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Great staff and food", "review": "The view during breakfast, while sitting out in the open was stunning, and the waiters were all very good at their job, and very cheerful and friendly, who after the first visit always addressed me as Mr Kevin, a great feeling for me, thank you.

Although say that, didn't feel like it was stuffy or snobby in any way - just classy.  The tasting menu + accompanying wine seems to be the go-to choice, however we decided to choose our own appetiser, entree and main and am glad we did. I had the mushroom, steak tartare and halibut and all of them were excellent - and rich. My wife had the tuna, salmon salad and snapper and once again, excellent - but rich. Don't get me wrong, we love rich food but maybe the last three nights were catching up with us.  We had a beautiful riesling and couldn't have been happier and shared desert bing the potato tart - which was my least favourite dish. It was a little tasteless, but then, after three rich dishes, probably a good thing.  Service was excellent. Table space excellent. Prices were in line with fine dinning and not over the top.

The food was amazing, i don't eat raw fish but last night i could have licked my plate and asked for more. Absolutely delicious. As was the Brussel sprout bisque, again something else i wouldn't eat at home. Griddled white asparagus next with amazing homemade XO sauce.

The duck beautifully prepared and presented. The turnip a revelation. The suckling pig: perfect crisp exterior, melt-in-your -mouth tender. Even the bread they make with little hints of chorizo & pecorino, made with lardo, served with two kinds of butter, and the potatoes delivered in a little cart... Five desserts? Kind of over-the-top I appreciate. The sommelier was from Sardinia. The waiter from Basilicata. They both were warm, helpful, and truly were a huge part of making our experience so enjoyable. Service from arrival to goodbyes: impeccable. If you come to London, put this on your list. But make a reservation.

The tasting menu was a real wow, specialising in classic French dishes with a a twist. Foie Gras with mussels, smoked potato with caviar, fresh pollock with cream sauce and fantastic duck with girolles and pumpkin. Dessert of pears with ginger was one of the best I\u2019ve ever tasted.

In fact, I cannot say this is a restaurant. It comprises of two rooms with tables and chairs on the first floor of a creepy building situated on an even creepier neighborhood, half an hour by car from the Old City. We arrived there at 7 PM. Our first belief was the taxi driver should have made a mistake, it seemed impossible to be a restaurant there. The neighborhood looked miserable, as well as the building we were in front of. A kid came and told us by gestures to go upstairs. We entered the \"restaurant\" and the first impression was very bad. At the end, the last impression was even worse. Let me summarize our experience there: - The owner was not there despite the fact we booked our table on day in advance, so he knew we will be there. No one else spoke English, so no communication was possible. - There were no waiters or waitresses. No personnel at all. - The kid invited us in the kitchen to see what snake we would have and eventually see how they kill it. I visited the kitchen (it would be better for me to not know how the kitchen looked like) but refused to see the slaughter. - To be fair, the owner called us and excused for not being there; his explanation was that he had to cook for his family. Great excuse! - It was supposed to have an 11-course dinner but we received only 9. - It was supposed to have snake wine to drink but the kid that served us brought only beer or coke. We asked for snake wine but he didn't (want to) understand our request. Eventually, I convinced the kid to call the owner and only I asked the owner for wine, the kid brought us a bottle. - Don't imagine this is a restaurant. It's a tourist trap. They don't accept credit cards, they don't give you any receipt. - The bill was 50 USD for two persons. Because we got there on our second day in Vietnam, we didn't know how big the bill was in comparison with other restaurants. After 14 days spent in various locations in Vietnam and eating only at restaurants, I can say the bill was HUGE! The next evening we went to the Essence Restaurant in Hanoi (the number 1 restaurant in Hanoi on TripAdvisor) and the bill for two persons was one-third (60% lower). - While we entered the taxi for going to the hotel, the kid ran after us waiving the money we paid. Only after the local taxi driver told him that the amount of money is right, the kid cooled down.  About the food: the only two good dishes were the two types of soup. Being the first time we had snake, we did't know what to expect for. Either the meat was badly cook or not, the taste was not good. Some dishes were not cooked well, i.e. the pieces of meat were dry and over-roasted. It looked like many dishes served were composed of leftovers. They didn't look like fresh cooked. We didn't find another place in Vietnam with such dull and bad food.  About the snake wine: IT IS NOT a wine!! I don't know why they are calling it \"wine\". It is a spirit, a fermented alcoholic beverage in which they put a snake. It is not very strong, maybe 25-30 ABV. I didn't like the taste. I tried it again on a day-trip to Mekong Delta and the taste was the same. It was not my style.  In a nutshell: go there only if you don't care about your money, about what you eat and how you are served. Elsewhere, go to any other place."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/OviCat", "user_id": "OviCat", "user_name": "OviCat", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Bucharest, Romania", "user_nb_contributions": 71.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 503.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 81.0, "user_nb_photos": 71.0, "user_tags": "Foodie"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "70483", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d2561769-Reviews-City_Lights_Bar-Istanbul.html", "review_date": "March 29, 2022", "review_city": "Istanbul, Turkey", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Amazing View", "review": "Probably the best views in Istanbul.

We chose the Bunker based on the menu and the cozy atmosphere and for the extensive cocktail list. It was easy to make a booking online which is essential as the restaurant is small . The cocktail bar is upstairs and has a large fireplace which on this night had a roaring fire. The bar has comfortable seating with leather deep buttoned couches. We had a MaiTai and a Toblerone which were delicious. service was good. The restaurant is downstairs through a secret door! The wait staff were very good. As stated the restaurant is small maybe 10 tables. We were seated at the back of the room with one other table behind us. The young lady on that table kept up a running commentary and we could hear everything she said! We didn't hear her partner at all so can only surmise she was talking loudly. For starters we had the Duck liver parfait which was really good and the Southern Ocean scallops which were also excellent but for $28 would have expected more than just 2 smallish scallops. There should have been at least 4 for that price. For mains we had the beef and the pork belly with pork loin. All competently prepared with flavoursome jus but the pork had no crackle. What!! pork belly with no crackle it's the best part!! We had 2 glasses of wine. 1 pinot gris and 1 Shiraz. We were too full for dessert. Had this been a memorable meal??? Probably for the wrong reason of the 2 scallops!! It was certainly good and in a tourist town like Queenstown they do appear to take pride in the food and their business.

The lunch (part of practical training) is always good and of very good value and quality. Choice of well composed Khmer or Western light set menus; I have never been disappointed. The fully inexperienced Khmer youngsters come straight from the absolutely most disfavored rural communities and show extraordinary will and pride in learning.

Since we were the only guests that time, it wasn\u2019t hard to get the desired table, and after a few drinks, we started to feel human again. The waitress was very accommodating, and at my second Tonic water, she automatically put the three ice cubes into it. Feeling resurrected, I picked up my camera and started to take photos. The Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosques were so close that we were nearly able to touch them. My partner ordered Spaghetti Bolognese, and I Chicken with Mushroom sauce. Both of us found our food tasty, but my chicken just missed that magic touch, that makes a dish delightful. All in all, it is hard not to give this restaurant the five but I would prefer the 4.5 because of the quality of the food. Nevertheless, the extraordinary 5,5 service with the view makes it five altogether. The location of the restaurant is also excellent since it is a very short walking distance away from the most attractive sites in Istanbul. Price-wise it is somewhere in the middle, other places without that stunning view charge the same price.

On the evening there was confusion with the staff regarding the menu, initially we were given a la carte menus despite the booking stating it was for the set menu.  In the end is was sorted, to a degree, as we were presented with a set menu option, but, not the one I had booked which included half a bottle of wine per person, apparently that one was not recognised and ours only included a glass of prosecco each! I decided not to make a fuss but clearly I was not happy especially for this mix up to happen in such a reputable hotel/restaurant*  Upon returning home I contacted the restaurant and Pawel was very apologetic and acknowledged that there was a glitch on the booking system and that he would make amends for our next visit......

In a nutshell, it was a top notch experience -Katie our waitress looked after us like we were VIP guests and it was nice to meet Pawel who gave us a warm welcome and also saw us to our table and last but not least Vanessa the Manageress who came over to say \"hello\". Vanessa was very personable and it was really enjoyable to chat with her.  The whole meal was excellent, my favourite is the slow cooked beef ragu in Chianti -a must try dish!  Sadly I have no immediate plans to return to London but Theo Randall will be on my to do list when I am next in town....."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 5.0}}]}}, {"id": "70515", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d719675-Reviews-Launceston_Place-London_England.html", "review_date": "May 30, 2022", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Good but could be better", "review": "Booked as a birthday treat.

But first We could not renounce to the temptation of tasting some beluga caviar which was excellent . The wine was excellent although it never reached the perfect temperature . My first course was bonito in tataki sauce which was delicious except for the chipped dish in which it was served . As a main course I choose a turbot with artichokes cooked in 3 ways, clams and a symphony of tastes that were exquisite .

It's served on Saturdays and Sundays between 11:30-15:00. The menu changes from week to week. The price is Czk. 1.290, - per person. It includes prosecco, red wine, white wine, beer, coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice and other soft drinks ad libitum. My boss, who is pretty awesome - and has asked me out several times this week - is in Prague with her husband, and I thought it appropriate to ask them out, just once. We usually attend the Grand Restaurant Festival together, but that\u2019s not an option this year. Instead we\u2019ve designed our own culinary week. The menu we had yesterday is below. Food is served at the table. We were given dishes to share, and we were pleased with the portion sizes, which allowed us to taste everything. By the time we had done that, we were also absolutely stuffed. Everything we were served was impressively delicious. The praise came in a stream from all three of us. We were impressed with the quality of the prosecco and wines included in what was effectively an all-you-can-drink package. The service was also absolutely perfect. The team of waiters were quite young and they were well trained in the profession, they were polite, friendly, helpful and had both humour and the courage to bring their personalities to work. When we arrived at 11:30, we discussed whether we could have arrived a little later and still had plenty of time before 15:00. But the service was kind enough to give us plenty of time between courses, we had a good time - and by 14:35 we were ready for dessert, which by the way was a feast of flavours and textures and one of the many highlights of the brunch. We'll be back!

It is safe to say that the restaurant didn\u2019t disappoint. We were all blown away by the experience. We were greeted by the manager (I believe) and sat down at a nice table. The interior of the restaurant has been redone, and we liked it. Particularly we liked the acoustics of the room. Noise doesn\u2019t travel from table to table, and we could have a relaxed conversation without raising our voices or listening in on whatever was being discussed by the table next to ours. We had a bowl of bread with 3 different kinds of fresh and slightly warm bread. It was accompanied by a herb spread which had nice, subtle flavours and a perfect temperature. I wanted more bread! But thank God they didn\u2019t give me any (I didn't ask for it), because we were all completely full, when we left the restaurant a couple of hours later. The amuse bouche was delicate foam of smoked potatoes. There were some crunchy bits on top and a bit of sour notes from tiny pieces of pickled vegetables as well. These 2 elements gave some texture, and it was a brilliant little dish. The starter was smoked char with almond milk \u201ccaviar\u201d, beluga lentils, horseradish, and marjoram. The trout had a firm, yet tender texture and had received just the right amount of smoke. The subtle horseradish sauce with marjoram complimented both fish and lentils very well and made everything come together. The lentils were perfectly cooked \u2013 I am not sure if \u201cal dente\u201d is a way to describe lentils, but I\u2019ll risk it. The almond milk caviar was mainly on the plate for texture, I believe \u2013 it didn\u2019t pack a lot of flavour. I like that the \u201ceggs\u201d had different sizes. That worked well visually and also when it came to the texture. The size of the portion was generous \u2013 we all agreed that it wouldn\u2019t have been strange at all, if they had served one piece of trout instead of the two nice portions on our plates. The main dish was veal rib eye, beans, dried beef, beets, cashews, and demi glace. We were given a choice how we would like our meat prepared, and we all chose medium. Mine was closer to medium rare, and that was perfectly fine with me. The first impression of the dish came from tasting the demi glace, which was one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. Only the master of sauces, Steven Trumpfheller, has served me a better one. So rich and full of flavour and reduced to the point where it would make my lips stick together. The steak was tender and well seasoned, and it hade more and deeper flavour than I would have expected from veal \u2013 more like a young bull. There were 3 different types of beans on the side, all cooked to perfection. The beets added an earthy and sweet/sour dimension, and the small bites of smoked and dried beef held it together, although my first bite was very tough (the rest weren\u2019t). Just as it was the case with the starter, everything on the plate created a perfect combination, and the dish was quite filling. I regretted not having saved a slice of bread to wipe my plate clean with. Not to embarrass my two friends at the table I decided not to lick the sauce off my plate, but the thought crossed my mind. The dessert was macaroon in two ways, cherry, chocolate, tangerine, and basil garnished with raspberries and a blackberry. The macaroon on the side was good, but to me the star of the dish was the clever composition in the middle. I tried tasting the different elements individually, and they went almost all the way around the palate, except for saltiness. Sweet, sour, tart, bitter. And then when they all met in combination with the chewy and a little bit gooey macaroon bottom, it was simply a heavenly mouthful. The menu mentions a pre-dessert as a palate cleanser. Previously it has been a ball of sorbet. They forgot to serve it at our table, but they found out and insisted that we had coffee on the house, accompanied with cute cubes of chocolaty caramel. It was a nice finish to our meal. The service was friendly and attentive, and we were given plenty of time between dishes, which we really appreciate. We were served by different waiters, but the manager always kept an eye on our table and checked every once in a while if we were happy \u2013 and it was a pleasure chatting with him. Hospitality must lie in his genes. We agreed that this final festival experience was a perfect ending to this year\u2019s adventure as a group \u2013 and most definitely we\u2019re looking forward to repeating it next year! There are 2 seats left for the Restaurant festival at Ml\u00fdnec this year: 1 seat on the 12/2 at 17:30 and 1 on the 16/2 at 17:30.

Our flight was supposed to arrive at 8:20pm, and their last order was at 10:15pm (be aware that even though they offer 10:30pm reservations on La Fourchette, they don't actually do that), so I initially canceled because I was worried we'd miss the reservation. They were exceedingly nice and understanding during the email exchange, and so when we arrived on time and realized we could still make it, we had our hotel call them, and they were able to accommodate us.  Particularly for a late night dinner, the meal was better than I could have expected. The servers were kind and didn't rush us at all even though we ordered the chef's menu. Particularly memorable was the artichoke soup which was divine, the best I'd ever had with bits of artichoke mixed in with the velvety smooth soup. My husband, who is usually a non-meat eater, said the lamb was one of the best he had tasted. If you come here, you must have the bread, even if you are trying to cut down on carbs. It's absolutely delicious. On this night, we had something that looked like parker rolls, but actually tasted like a nice focaccia, and a perfectly baked sourdough slice.  If you are a dessert lover like me, you will love the long list of some of the most scrumptious choices I've seen at a restaurant in a long time. The menu came with a caramel mille-feuille, which I enjoyed, but I also saw tantalizing plates of souffl\u00e9s, berry tarts etc etc making its way toward other tables. I would love to come and just eat all of their desserts.  The restaurant was located inside the Bristol hotel, which is a former palace. The warm and unpretentious service combined with the amazing food even made me curious about staying here next time.  Pricewise, this is a one Michelin restaurant, so it's in the typical range of similarly rated establishments. Frankly, however, this was a better meal than two-Michelin places we've been to on out previous trip two months ago, so from that perspective we considered it to be, maybe not a bargain, but completely worth it."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/yukarik429", "user_id": "Yukari K", "user_name": "Yukari K", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Chicago, Illinois", "user_nb_contributions": 182.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 366.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 209.0, "user_nb_photos": 14.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Like a Local;Peace and Quiet Seeker;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "70605", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d15614126-Reviews-The_Rajdoot_Hampstead-London_England.html", "review_date": "May 30, 2021", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Raise a Glass to the Rajdoot!", "review": "We enjoyed our final meal of the holiday here at Rajdoot and were a little apprehensive as all meals so far over the weekend had been very good.

From the moment we exited the taxi outside the staff were out to greet us, very friendly and made us all feel welcome. You can tell that they all care about their business as they couldn\u2019t do enough for us and even offered us complimentary drinks at the end of the meal. There were all the traditional offerings and some nice specialities too. We had Jalfrezi , chicken saag, and a king prawn korma and I liked the option to have your chicken grilled / tandoori as a opposed to plain. Of course we had poppodums and chutney to start, who doesn\u2019t? All washed down with ice cold Cobra beer. I think everyone was slightly jealous of my wife\u2019s Chicken Saag, not only was it delicious but it came in the hit sizzling pot, which I always feels adds to the experience and I\u2019d encourage them to serve the jalfrezi this way! I\u2019m not sure if this is practical but it certainly makes the table go \u201cooooh\u201d as the sizzling dish approaches. I also liked the fact that when I asked fir my naan bread well done it came nice and crispy just as ordered. Seating was covid friendly and waiters wore face masks so no issues with hygiene/ CV19 To finish off our fabulous evening the waiter allowed my son in law to take away his beautiful cobra glass that he\u2019d been eyeing all evening, which I felt was a lovely touch and made Toms night!

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "706138", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

We went for one of the set menus as it makes us eat dishes we would not ordinarily order. Most were fantastic. The rest were good.  The setting for the restaurant was lovely. Trees and a pond in front of the stage. The music and the dancing, provided at no extra charge was really pleasant and the be costumes bright and colourful. Made for a really pleasant evening.

The amuse bouche of warm lobster was a stella beginning to a fabulous evening with lovely pink champagne and moving on to a delightful Provencal ros\u00e9. Dessert was heavenly as was the aged Calvados to finish of perfect evening. Staff were knowledgeable about each dish and very helpful, indeed they welcomed the opportunity to discuss the menu in detail.

Ordered drinks and waited for the rest of our party to arrive. Everyone arrived but one person arrived by 8.10pm. Waiters come up and took our drinks order and we sat and waited. By 8.45pm we were wondering what was happening with the table so I asked the waitress and they said that they had given away our table as we weren't all here on time. Outraged I asked why no one had told us. Blank faced ignored the question and told me that we were all late and that's the policy. I then asked to speak to the manager who was just as clueless and rude. Not explaining why he had given away our table without informing us. Arriving early and being told to wait in the bar they knew we were waiting for the table yet still they ignored us. The manager said there's nothing he can do as there are no tables and we should wait. By 9.15pm we were still waiting and by then my party was frustrated, hungry and shocked at the service being received. No apology was given and no one seemed to care. We ended up leaving the restaurant and the whole birthday celebration was ruined. We had all travelled from out of London just to be ignored and treated like rubbish.  I would never return to this place again. Clearly it's popular because of the chefs performances when cooking the food but the service is terrible. No people skills.

I elected to have the patties cooked medium well, and the result was a juicy burger with two patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and the tomato aioli sauce. The Big Boy, another winner with the crispy bacon topping the patties. Toasted pineapple slices gave the Waikiki a different taste sensation and the Croc Dundee with the fried egg and beetroot was just an amazing meal. Mustn\u2019t forget the onion rings and the ice cold Changs. My wife enjoyed her Blues Brothers (without the bun) and on other nights the chicken wings , chicken on green plate and those tasty chips.

The waiters were nice and attentive and gave us the time we needed to explain my non-english-speaking parents the menu. Then the waiter came with a plate with the different kinds of meat and they all just looked amazing. We took 2 x the filet steak and 2 x the Ribeye, we wanted to take side dishes per person, but the waiter advised us, to only go with two side dishes - which was a very good advise, because the steaks were quite big, we couldn't even finish the side dishes. And the meat - let me tell you - it was amazing! it was perfectly grilled, it was tender, juicy and so tasty! They also have a broad selection of wines, which vary in price ranges - we took a bottle of a Malbec for around 30USD I think, which was absolutely worth it. The evening was an outstanding experience, food and service wise.

Please, stop! Good Indian food is about wholesome ingredients, perfectly chosen meats and seafood, cultural secrets, and a chef that can take all this and toss it up into something spectacular. The Crossing (TC) has managed to do just this and a lot more! You first enter a very lovely looking restaurant with some minimalism infused with contemporary style and are greeted by extremely friendly staff who really want you to enjoy your evening out. They are also very clued in on all the food, it's origin, what to pair it with, and how that particular story unfolded. Kudos to really explaining everything with zest, passion, and heart! Let's get one thing straight - TC is not out there to be another 'find dining but so-boring' restaurant. They are not cluttering tables with 17 glasses per person and more cutlery than a wedding demands. It's all about simplicity and passion here. As soon as you settle in, the first thing you will probably notice (apart from the brilliant music) are the faces of the other patrons Pure joy is what you will see. This really gives you a lot of confidence about the food. We ordered a LOT of food because everything sounded so good! Gunpowder prawns, butter chicken, saag (which I have NEVER ordered before, ever), dal moradabad (fantastic!), mango seafood curry, keema rice (the simplicity and flavours of this dish were amazing), lamb and chicken grills, and breads. Each dish's level of spice and taste/flavour was a 100% on point. There was a little quirkiness in every dish too, which only added to the brilliance of the experience. Again, nothing even remotely OTT (think in the lines of pairing a Gucci suit with some Air Jordans or Yeezys - brilliant, huh??) Honestly, I had not enjoyed some of the ingredients being paired together in so many ways as I did at TC. Some brilliant research work done on our country's varied gastronomies and many exhaustive hours spent in the kitchen, for sure. Overall, highly recommended to everyone who wants a taste of the India that effortlessly mixes the north with the south and the east with the west and then does it all again! I'll be back soon, with a new bunch of people I can take there to showcase what Indians do best - serve and surprise."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/RahulChopra", "user_id": "Rahul C", "user_name": "Rahul C", "user_ta_level": 4.0, "user_age_range": "25-34", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Dubai, United", "user_nb_contributions": 16.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 210.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 6.0, "user_nb_photos": 11.0, "user_tags": "Urban Explorer;Thrill Seeker;Trendsetter"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "70714", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293734-d15286316-Reviews-Cafe_Restaurant_Dar_L_hssira-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html", "review_date": "February 9, 2023", "review_city": "Marrakech, Morocco", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Brilliant, just go and see", "review": "We visited for dinner based on the other reviews here and they certainly weren't lying.

The \"puerta cerrada\" (or \"closed door\") movement is new to us, but we'll be searching it out more often. What sets Casa Salt Shaker apart (aside from the food and drink, but more on that later) is the communal table. While many closed door restaurants have gone to traditional restaurant style seating, Casa Salt Shaker has maintained their communal table which made for a delightful evening. We sat with 8 other English speaking guests from the US (living in Chile, and living in Alaska), UK and New Zealand. What a diverse and well traveled and engaging group!  Now - the food! Dan is a master in the kitchen! Three of us were pescatarians, so Dan made an entire pescatarian-friendly meal. The meat eaters among us were thrilled to take a break from their Argentine meat frenzy. We savored homemade bread, Peruvian ceviche, Timbuche (the most delicious cilantro/albacore soup I've ever had!), corn ravioli, pollack with chimichurri hollandaise, and pineapple cheesecake, along with perfectly paired wines. Along with being an extraordinary cook, Dan is also a wonderful conversationalist and we learned a lot about life as an expat in Argentina. Dan doesn't speak much English but is delightful with his shy smile and quiet demeanor. The $80 (US) that we spent each was an incredible value given the quality (and quantity) of the food and wine, No tiny tastes or mere splashes of wine here."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Lorija62", "user_id": "Lorija62", "user_name": "Lori R", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Falmouth, Massachusetts", "user_nb_contributions": 98.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 124.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 56.0, "user_nb_photos": 68.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Luxury Traveler;Family Vacationer"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "70716", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}]}}, {"id": "70717", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d7691911-Reviews-Sokkhak_River_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "December 14, 2022", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "A m a i z I n g", "review": "Great diner.

Unfortunately Grill 63 fails to deliver on any level of expectations.  Positives: Great space, Fantastic 360 degree views of Hanoi. Decent Rooftop Bar which feels like a copy of Bangkok's Sirocco Rooftop bar, (without the glitz or glam but with the same lofty prices)  Negatives: The produce for a 5 Star Hotel is terrible. (Shame on you F&B Director) you would get better food at your local pub.  The space whilst gorgeous, feels like a marketplace when the buffet is running. It's not helped by the many families that would bring children and let them loose to run around as if it's day care.  The service; well they try. Vietnam isn't going to get on Michelin's map any time soon, but the most simple place to start is service. Basic rules and attentiveness would go a long way.

Sure - you can just drink the drinks for theatre and get drunk and fall off your bar stool.  But what we learned over 3 nights is just how much time, energy, intelligence and creativity goes into the formulation of the recipes AND the ingredients that go into them. They make many of their own ingredients, and the processes take a long time and a lot of care and skill.  Now, to the cocktails.  They are unique, fun, beautifully balanced and well worth trying. I won\u2019t say much about them, but if you want to sit at a bar, dressed in a laboratory coat and a safety mask, while a cocktail basically explodes in front of you, this is the place to go!

Food was fabulous, my wife is a vegetarian and she had plenty of choice too. We had 3 courses including drinks and paid around 60 Euro which for the quality of the food and service was more than reasonable in my opinion.  The staff were very good and if i was to give them any developmental feedback it would be to take a little more time with the diners as I did feel a little rushed on the second night. I appreciate they want to turn tables but they should be leaving gaps of at least 15 to 20 mins between courses.

Almost every table was marked \"reserved\" when we arrived at opening.  There is a good reason for the reservations because the food is so delicious, so flavorful, and home cooked right behind the counter by the husband of the husband/wife team. The wife serves the food and takes the orders and she is SO friendly (unless you dont have a reservation).  They have a good wine selection and the menu is significantly large. I was feeling a little under the weather when we got there so I got a soup - oh my gosh - it was just a simple mushroom soup but we soaked up every last drop with the bread and she came over and hugged us because she saw me soaking up the last bit of liquid and laughed at us. But it was that good. We also got the tomato balls, a must for being in Greece, and they were served with tzatziki, SO GOOD. My husband complimented that for a fried food it was so light. We also got the beer chicken and a seabass - both were amazing, we finished basically everything. They also give a complimentary dessert (assuming they rotate). Ours was some phyllo dough with some cream maybe (not really sure) but so good. The wife also takes a picture of every table and puts it on her facebook site, which I think is pretty cool.  We wanted to go back a second time in our 3 dinners we had in Santorini, but then figured we should try something else....regreted not going back.

The response confirming my booking was quick and we arrived as arranged. We were allocated a nice table and enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant that is set in a nicely wooded area with atmospheric candles and lighting. Service was good and efficient, perhaps a little bit too much so. We ordered several glasses of wine before we ordered food and at 5 US dollars a glass, it was good value. My wife and I both ordered the same food, starting with a green mango and crispy fish salad, followed by Stir Fry vegetables in an Oyster sauce with rice. A pre-starter arrived which was pleasant enough. The starter was fresh, piquant and tasty. The stir fry vegetables of the main course arrived quickly after, perhaps a little too quickly, and were only luke-warm, as was the sticky rice giving me the impression it had been sat around waiting for us to finish our starter. However, it was tasty and the vegetables were a la dente as they should be. Whereas the food wasn't top notch, it was perfectly acceptable and for the price, good value when one considers that the traditional Cambodian music/dancing that takes place from 7.30pm until 8.30pm is included in the price. We both had an enjoyable evening which was perfect for our first night n Cambodia. The restaurant was almost full so created a good atmosphere. If in Siem Reap, Art Shadow restaurant is well worth considering for a good night out with reasonable food, good entertainment and warm service.

Clearly, technically of the highest level. The accompanying (French) wines were well chosen and of very good quality. We did have a look at the winelist also. It contains a very long list of mainly French wines (they also have wines from other countries, but the most extensive list is the French one), in line with the name of the restaurant.  Although we told the waiter we were not in a hurry, the speed of serving the courses was rather high. Service was rather routinely performed, in what appeared a hurry and not that personal. The waiter that brought the dishes was not able to explain them, other than the main ingredient (\"duck!\"). That was a pity; perhaps it was a language issue.  For this high class restaurant, pricing was fully acceptable but on the high end in Prague.  All in all, technically perfect cooking, a nice atmosphere, but it would be nice if the service would be somewhat more relaxed and informative."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ML-NL-Amf", "user_id": "ML-NL-Amf", "user_name": "ML-NL-Amf", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Amersfoort, The", "user_nb_contributions": 214.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 113.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 78.0, "user_nb_photos": 24.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Urban Explorer;Like a Local;History Buff"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "70805", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d719852-Reviews-Pur_Jean_Francois_Rouquette-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "review_date": "May 2, 2015", "review_city": "Paris, France", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Amazing Pur", "review": "Just a fabulous experience, staff were outstanding and the good was even better.

There is no shortage of wonderful places to eat when you are visiting this city. But be sure to include this one in your list.  The meal is done as a set menu - everyone gets the same dinner (excepting allergies). So it makes it simple, with no choices to make. The toughest decision is whether to have the wine pairing (4 glasses), or not. Have it.  The 7-course meal is presented slowly, and beautifully. It takes about 2 to 3 hours to get though dinner, and each course is fairly small. So although it may sound like 7 dishes is a lot, it feels perfect.  The restaurant, operated by the Kimsan Twins (I don't think they are actually twins), is entirely staffed by women. The kitchen, clearly visible from the first floor dining room, shows the skilled chefs at work, and provides a show to watch between courses.

We were allocated a nice table and enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant that is set in a nicely wooded area with atmospheric candles and lighting. Service was good and efficient, perhaps a little bit too much so. We ordered several glasses of wine before we ordered food and at 5 US dollars a glass, it was good value. My wife and I both ordered the same food, starting with a green mango and crispy fish salad, followed by Stir Fry vegetables in an Oyster sauce with rice. A pre-starter arrived which was pleasant enough. The starter was fresh, piquant and tasty. The stir fry vegetables of the main course arrived quickly after, perhaps a little too quickly, and were only luke-warm, as was the sticky rice giving me the impression it had been sat around waiting for us to finish our starter. However, it was tasty and the vegetables were a la dente as they should be. Whereas the food wasn't top notch, it was perfectly acceptable and for the price, good value when one considers that the traditional Cambodian music/dancing that takes place from 7.30pm until 8.30pm is included in the price. We both had an enjoyable evening which was perfect for our first night n Cambodia. The restaurant was almost full so created a good atmosphere.

Casa SaltShaker is the most fun food experience I've had so far in South America.  A communal table is a great idea, plain and simple. You might have to be slightly outgoing to go here, but if you can bare the thought of meeting new, interesting people, and talking to them over food and wine, this is the place for you. I went to this in-house restaurant with a friend of mine, and we had a blast meeting people from the U.S., Germany, England and Argentina.  But over to the most important thing: the food and drinks. The night opened with an amazing yerba mate gin cocktail, accompanied by light conversation with our newly acquainted co-guests. Good whole wheat bread was quickly followed by a really good smoked mozzarella cheese starter. Like the rest of the meal, the dish was perfectly seasoned - and slightly spicy.  One of the two shining highlights of the night was the hummus and cauliflower soup, paired with an amazing chardonnay. A slight touch of chili gave the table a slight scare, but every spoonful made the soup increasingly more satisfying. This is the kind of soup I would like to keep 20 liters of in my freezer for comfort food emergencies.  The third dish of the night was the weirdest one. Burnt pasta with squid, tomatoes and eggplants. Some of the guests struggled with the texture of the pasta, but I didn't really mind. The flavors were exceptional, and the ros\u00e9 wine pairing was surprisingly great.  The fourth course, the main course, was the star of the night for me. I hate when people overcook birds, but this night the stuffed quail was cooked perfectly pink. An amazing tahini sauce, the pancetta in the stuffing, the crunchy pomegranate seeds - everything came together to make a complete dish. A deep, rich cabernet sauvignon exemplified how wine heightens food.  For dessert, we got a juicy banana cake, paired with a rich chocolate mousse, peanut cream and a syrup with a chili sting. The paired dessert wine was not over-the-top sweet, and went well with the rich dessert.  I left the place stuffed, satisfied and happy. I would recommend Casa SaltShaker to anyone with an adventurous palate and an open mind. For the gourmets of the world: spend a night in this cozy house if you're in Buenos Aires."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hansolavrise", "user_id": "hansolavrise", "user_name": "Hans-Olav R", "user_ta_level": 4.0, "user_age_range": "18-24", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Oslo, Norway", "user_nb_contributions": 22.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 97.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 20.0, "user_nb_photos": 4.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Urban Explorer;Like a Local;Peace and Quiet Seeker"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "70841", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d719675-Reviews-Launceston_Place-London_England.html", "review_date": "March 25, 2019", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Exceptional", "review": "Located on an unassuming picture postcard South Kensington Street, Launceston Place is understated Michelin level cuisine at an affordable price.

Tables are situated around a pool and a central marble courtyard with a mosaic clad fountain. A large speaker provides some cool background beats. The restaurant offers two menus \u2013 Moroccan and Italian \u2013 with the ability to mix and match both. The latter offered a welcome break from the traditional tagines. The king prawns with diced tomatoes and cocktail sauce and the eggplant mozzarella for starters were both beautifully seasoned and bursting with flavour and the home made fettucine and tortellini parmesan cream for main brought back fond memories of some of the best Italian pasta houses. There is an extensive wine list although the Moroccan wine is slightly on the expensive side. The only downside was the service which can best be described as unfriendly and unengaging and we felt a little rushed with courses arriving quickly when we had indicated we would like a break or, in the case of the bill, unprompted. It was slightly odd to be taken to a back room to pay the bill by credit card but I had nothing to fear in that all of the staff were extremely courteous and polite. This was our stand out favourite restaurant during our nine night stay in Marrakesh and we cannot wait to return.  Tip: Ignore the young men waiting to greet you when you leave the restaurant who will seek to persuade you to follow them on a different route back to the main square on the basis that the conventional route is closed at night. This is a standard ruse at this (and many other) locations and an attempt to fleece you of your hard earned dirhams\u2026\u2026"}}, "output": {"review_rating": 5.0}}]}}, {"id": "70842", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d7260612-Reviews-Embassy_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "February 17, 2020", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "A Magical Culinary Experience in a Magical Place", "review": "If you\u2019re in Siem Reap for one night or more, make sure you dine at this restaurant.

Once everyone arrived, you're brought into the dining room facing the open kitchen and windows that look out onto a terrace where Luis is preparing the wood grill. Before the first course, the fresh cuts of meat and cheese are presented and explained.  Each of the four courses are paired with a local wine which is generously (and continuously), poured. There was so much food and the delicious steaks were so huge that no one was able to finish everything beyond the salad course. I found the $75 per person price more than reasonable given the quality and quantity of both the food and wine.  Steaks by Luis is a closed door restaurant so you must make reservations in advance.

There are many restaurants in Siem Reap but POU has earned its distinctive star along with other gourmet restaurants like Malis and Khema. It is very vegetarian friendly. The menu harbours a limited number of extremely delicious items. I highly recommend this place. It is casual, near Wat Damnak and manager may be present at times as he manages the other POU, great to meet the CHEF who usually is at the other resto but i met him here.

We first went because we were a little tired after arriving and it was easy. The 7 course Khmer tasting menu changes every night so no chance of getting bored with the food. There is an \"normal\" menu as well if you don't feel adventurous.  We had the tasting menu and enjoyed it very much. At $31 per head, it is great value. Wine is available at various price levels.We though the courses came out a little fast, but that is often the case in Asia, The size of the tasting plates was just right. I would comment that the wine was not quite chilled enough, but some time in the bucket solved that. Not a big problem.

The staff coped really well with the level of demands placed upon them and if you understand that some of them were relatively inexperienced because of the basis on which the business operates then this was even more impressive. The lady manager for the night had only to keep a watching brief and scarcely intervene at all.  The food remains excellent - the fried beef with red ants is a must try. Coupled with great value for money and free pick up and drop off service it make it a first class choice.

We were quite surprised that after such a long time the restaurant was still making memories for locals and tourists alike.  This is not a restaurant that you decide to drop in on at the last minute. It's often booked out well in advance and sports around 7 or so tables for a very intimate dining experience with friends or loved ones. In fact, we booked over a month in advance to make sure they could seat our party of 5.  Plan to take your time and this is one location that it pays to trust the kitchen, as they have a fantastic degustation menu, featuring ingredients from the South Island of New Zealand. Matching New Zealand wines are also on offer and in my opinion you're missing a fabulous experience if you choose to \u00e0 la carte.  We started the evening with cocktails followed by a dish titled \"Amuse\" - described as a daily creation or local delicacy. On this day, we were served a starter of Cervena Venison. It came cooked perfectly with 3 beautiful contrasting sauces.  The next dish was a choice from the Southern Ocean or Marlborough region, scallops or wild boar respectively. I chose the boar - Mille Peuille of apple, parsnip remoulade with a well matched Amisfield Pinot Gris from Central Otago.  The next course hailed from the West Coast or Bannockburn - Conit of baby abalone, or Seared Loin of hare and braised leg. The hare was served with confit kumura (New Zealand native sweet potato), sour cherries, kawakawa jus and a Surveyor Thompson Pinot Noir from Central Otago.  A nice little citrus sorbet followed as a palate cleanser.  The Main course was either a Centrol Otago Alpine Merino lamb backstrap and braised neck, or Nelson sourced seared pink snapper. The Merino Lamb was spectacular, served with baby vegetables, pea sponge, thyme jus and a Church Road Reserve Merlot/Cabernet blend from the Hawkes Bay.  Dessert was a classic New Zealand kiwi fruit pavola with local fruit and mascarpone with a Brancott Letter Series Late Harvest Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough.  Lastly, we were treated to a local cheese selection with figs, nuts and a Cloudy Bay Late Harvest Riesling from Marlborough once again.  The wait staff were fantastic. Every course was described in detail and the quality of service was second to none.  Treat yourself to an experience and make sure The Bunker is on your list when you next visit Queenstown.

The menu has some Thai traditional dishes but also some not so well known ones and the Grouper with three sauces is our favourite. It comes filleted and has amazing flavours. We ate here twice and if we were here another day we would have been back for a third day. Definitely one of the highlights of staying at this hotel.

The 'meat' tagine was tasty though the meat was very fatty. Our table was cleared quickly but no one came near us after that; there were five, then four tables in use upstairs and the waiter brought dishes to the table near the top of the stairs several times but made avoiding eye contact into an art! After about three quarters of an hour we, and one of the other diners, got fed up and went downstairs to settle our bills and leave. The restaurant is extremely basic, but that was OK; the food we got to eat was very good but the service was just off-putting. The two people in the kitchen looked busy but we would have been happy to wait for desserts if someone had just glanced over to see if we wanted anything.

But every other course was amazing - full of delicious flavours, fresh ingredients and always a refreshing take on traditional Khmer cuisine, infused with modern cooking techniques. My favourite was the dessert - a fusion of western and Asian flavours - ice cream, and traditional cakes from Asia.  The restaurant is also beautifully furnished and the wait staff were attentive and responsive. At the end of our meal, one of the chefs came out to meet us and was open to our feedback about the pork course.

The toughest decision is whether to have the wine pairing (4 glasses), or not. Have it.  The 7-course meal is presented slowly, and beautifully. It takes about 2 to 3 hours to get though dinner, and each course is fairly small. So although it may sound like 7 dishes is a lot, it feels perfect.  The restaurant, operated by the Kimsan Twins (I don't think they are actually twins), is entirely staffed by women. The kitchen, clearly visible from the first floor dining room, shows the skilled chefs at work, and provides a show to watch between courses.

The service was great, but the food fell short of expectations, and was very pricey. Our neighbor makes samosas and shares them with the neighborhood, and we expected the same authenticity at Ustav. Unfortunately, the flavors and textures were not there. I ordered the butternut squash soup, which was delicious, but the chicken tikka masala did nothing for me, nor did the kulfi, which I found to be almost too frozen to cut into and more a savory dish than a dessert.

The place is rather small and in a basement. The neighborhood it lays in doesn't really reflect the inside.  Without a reservation you will be seated in the bar area, the music is rather loud but not a nuisance. If you'd like to dine calm I'd advice to make a reservation.  The staff is helpful, but the door keeper at the entrance isn't like, welcoming.  We ordered a 2 cocktails and some food. The cocktails are nicely presented, but as you'll learn in Morocco lots of alcohol. I felt that the mix of the Aperol Spritz was missing and the taste was overkill by the overkill of Aperol. Bellini isn't as nice as the original, not bad but misses that typical martini taste.  Food, portions are rather small and it's adviced to order a dessert or entree if you have more hunger. The wait time is rather long (+-45 minutes) so calculate that in.  Overall I had a mixed feeling. My appetite was a bit gone by the burning smell of some cocktails and the loud music. Tastes of the food are good, but there are better places in Marrakech where you can eat the same for less money. Cocktails are fine if you can handle the alcohol.  Might had a different experience if I sat in the restaurant part.  Finally, the price. It's comparable to European restaurants.

Service this year felt remarkably different. In the past we always received a gluten-free menu for my celiac husband without asking (I specify in my booking that he needs a gluten-free meal). This year we had to ask for it. I ordered a cocktail and my husband an aperitif. Before we even received them, the waiter asked if we wanted to order our meal. I don't think I have ever had that happen in a Michelin-starred restaurant. It felt like dining in a cafe. We said we would prefer to have our drinks and then order. In prior years we always looked forward to the mignardise at the end of the meal. They would always tell my husband which things he could have and fill in with macarons if too many of the usual mignardise had gluten. This time we noticed we were the only table that didn't receive any. We asked the waiter and he said that my husband would not be able to eat them (not true - they included macarons). I asked why did I not get any. He said he assumed that I would not want any if my husband could not have any. That's like saying I would not eat bread at a meal if he couldn't have any. We asked for a manager and he apologized and we got our mignardise. I gave my husband ones that I knew were OK for him and they obviously were since he had no effect from them. The manager gave us his card and assured us that next time he would make sure we were properly taken care of.

From appetizers (my daughter and I had oysters and husband spring rolls) to our main course, the food was excellent! The wines were (New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc and Shiraz) were paired well.

The lady serving us was appeared confused, did not know what was on the menu (the menu id not particularly lengthy) and paid poor attention to us even though it was fairly empty. Instead both her and her colleague focused on two gentlemen who we assumed were regularly from their conversations. We also waited a very long time after having our plates cleared away before being offered desert.

When walking into the restaurant hostess greeted and guided us to a nice table (by the way: if you want to have a nice and tranquil dinner go for the upper level as they feature an 'open' kitchen on lower level which may be a bit noisy... )  The reason why 114 is awarded 1 star is an A-Level-Service and dishes of exceptional quality!  And we appreciated the fact that you do not feel to dine in a 'hotel-restaurant' because it has a separate entrance from the street.  The menu basically gives the choice of some nice meat and fish courses (salmon was over-the-top!!!) and so far it is the only michelin-starred restaurant serving a burger...

Each course was explained to us and we found the presentation and balance of flavours quite superb - we enjoyed every bite.This is a restaurant serving world-class food and we would highly recommend it, we cannot wait to return."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ericcantona", "user_id": "ericcantona", "user_name": "ericcantona", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Powfoot, United", "user_nb_contributions": 76.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 135.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 102.0, "user_nb_photos": 2.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Peace and Quiet Seeker;Beach Goer;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": [{"id": "7011270", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1231757-d10521879-Reviews-Rock_Salt-Nai_Harn_Rawai_Phuket.html", "review_date": "April 22, 2023", "review_city": "Phuket, Thailand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Disappointing service, not worthy of a 5 star hotel", "review": "We have eaten here before when staying at the Nai Harn so booked a table for our first evening in the hotel.

Seriously, we speak so highly of this restaurant, even compared to the Embassy.  We had the fresh spring rolls and the pomelo salad, the outstanding beef loc lac, fish soup, and chicken Khmer curry. We had three traditional Cambodian desserts. The loc lac was amazing! Amazing! The Khmer curry was the absolute best of all the places we dined at in Siem Reap. Honestly and truthfully, so amazing. As a matter of fact, while we were fine dining at the Embassy, we were contemplating heading over to Haven after to scoop up a heartier meal. The desserts were delicious and like written online, were not sweet, swimming in coconut milk, and served hot. Everything was a winner and the chef was able to make the fried calamari gluten-free as well.  Danke Schoen for the best meal. So looking forward to dining at Haven on our next visit.

They were in London for a game, and were using the JW Marriott as their base of operations. I then have returned several more times, and been impressed each time. In December, we were back to London, and on a totally leisure trip. We were staying just down Park Lane from the JW Marriott, and my wife asked if we could go to The Park Room for drinks. Well, that was a no-brainer - wines with my wife, with no meetings looming over her head, in a lovely space, just blocks from us. Off we went.  Now, there are three areas of The Park Room, and two are mostly attached, plus a lounge area, just around the corner, with a grand piano, which is more open to the reception area of the lobby. We were seated in the lounge area, near the piano, and I had the wine list in hand quickly. On this afternoon, the pianist was playing, and I think that this is only the second time, when he has been there - quite, quite good! Though the main dining room is gorgeous, one of the things that I like about the lounge area is that it has more of an open view of the attractive lobby - though no views out onto Park Lane, as that main dining area has.  We did the Henri de Villamont Clos Du Cromin Meursault \u201813, the Guillaume Vrignaud Fourchaume Chablis 1er Cru \u201815, and the Spelt \u201cLa Valentina\u201d Montepulciano D\u2019Abruzzo Riserva DOC \u201814. The wine service was great, but while the stemware was attractive (those are Park Room \u201csignature glasses\u201d), I was not that big a fan of the open bowl design - lovely to look at, but not my favorite for wines.  It\u2019s now a tossup, whether I like the main dining room, or this little lounge area the better, but that might depend on whether the pianist is playing. We will be returning, as we have since making this discovery, a few years back.  Though this September visit was our first stay at the JW Marriott Grosvenor House Park Lane Mayfair/London, I had visited The Park Room twice before, once solo, and once with a friend, but this was the very first visit for my wife.  We had arrived from the States a bit too early to check into our room, in the hotel - but this was no surprise, as we had to take a flight out of LAX, rather than SFO, so knew we would be at least an hour - or two - early. That was not to be helped. We did the formalities, and told the reservations agent that we would just find some Champagne in the Park Room.  On this early Spring afternoon, it was as lovely, as I remembered it to be, with sunlight streaming through the windows, overlooking Park Lane, and Hyde Park. This is an elegant room, there is no denying, but it is also a very comfortable room, at least it was for us.  We were seated by the welcoming hostess, at a nice little 2-top, in the main dining area. While not against the windows, we still had a lovely view. From my previous experience, I believe that the dining area, at those windows, is most often used for Afternoon Tea, as it has much more of a salon feel, and look to it. We were in the main dining area, just behind that salon.  We had the wine list in hand, and settled in to relax, enjoy ourselves, and await our room assignment - knowing that we probably had at least an hour, or more.  We started with Perrier-Jou\u00ebt Blanc de Blanc, and a glass of the Perrier-Jou\u00ebt Blason Ros\u00e9. Both were served in lovely flutes.  We sipped, and relaxed, as we had been flying for quite some time, and when the Champagne was gone, moved on to Soellner Gr\u00fcner Veltliner Fumburg \u201816 (a new wine to me), and the Henri de Villamont Meursault \u201815 (also a new producer - we were having fun now).  About half of the way through the still whites, our reservations agent arrived, and offered to show us to our suite, as soon as we had finished the wine. She made certain to give our server the room number, for the charges, which was a nice touch, as we did not need to bother with a credit card.  The afternoon had almost slipped by, and the wait was of no issue. We were in a lovely room, watching Hyde Park across the way, with excellent, and very friendly and attentive service, plus getting to explore some new wines. What a great way to start a holiday. I am so glad that my wife finally got to experience The Park Room, and now it was time to unpack, shower, and head back down to the lobby for dinner - with even more wine!"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Loup_Garou", "user_id": "The_Loup_Garou", "user_name": "The_Loup_Garou", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "65+", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Phoenix, Arizona", "user_nb_contributions": 373.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 931.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 777.0, "user_nb_photos": 686.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;History Buff;60+ Traveler"}, "history": [{"id": "7011500", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1017662-Reviews-The_Park_Room-London_England.html", "review_date": "June 5, 2020", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Lovely & Elegant With a Fun Wine List", "review": "Lovely & Elegant With a Fun Wine List  Though this September visit was our first stay at the JW Marriott Grosvenor House Park Lane Mayfair/London, I had visited The Park Room twice before, once solo, and once with a friend, but this was the very first visit for my wife.

Decent food, nothing really outstanding! Mediocre Wines.", "review": "We had an OK night at casa SaltShaker, but in the end it was a disappointmet, because we  expected MUCH more.  First of all, the food was ok - there's nothing to complain about. However, it wasn't anyting really special. This is definitely NOT world class, in a city famous for its abundance of world class restaurants. Of course, this insight was a disappointment!  The best way to describe what I mean is:  If I was invited to a hobby cook's house and he cooked such a meal, it would be great. If however somebody pretending to be a knowledgable chef invited me to his and cooked this menu for me, I would clearly think that he was not trying nearly as hard as he could, but was saving efforts...  The Casa Saltshaker guys are definitely to be attributed to the hobby cook area...the problem is that TA rates them in the other category (and they think that they belong there...)  The HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT was however was the complete abscence of any personal interaction on behalf of the \"hosts\". When you \"invite\" somebody into your home and you do not wish to exchange even a word with your \"guests\", this is really a bummer. I had the feeling that they were desperate to put us through the process as quickly as possible, collect our money and send us home.  I certainly didn't feel welcome there.  Exemplatory for the attitude towards their guest was this episode:  Coming in I was thirsty and aksed for a glass of water. They rejected it by saying that they would start serving dinner in 10min. REALLY!? Is THAT hospitality?! No one had ever before denied me a glass of water :-)  Making up for the desaster that our hosts were was a quite nice mix of guests with whom we've had a fun evening anyway, despite the hosts (unfortunately not because of them :-)  Last but not least, the wine \"pairing\" we had with the meal was mediocre. We have had wine pairings in good places in Buenos Aires, so we know what can be expected in this price range. The guys either don't have a clue about wine or they simply don't care (I suppose it's the latter, because it fits the overall picture)."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Kamen_777", "user_id": "Kamen_777", "user_name": "Kamen_777", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Sofia, Bulgaria", "user_nb_contributions": 332.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 221.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 231.0, "user_nb_photos": 13.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Like a Local;Nature Lover;Peace and Quiet Seeker"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "701156", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g10086747-d17643042-Reviews-Bondi_Cafe-Tibubeneng_North_Kuta_Bali.html", "review_date": "August 21, 2019", "review_city": "Bali, Indonesia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "what we like and did not like", "review": "right after a 1-hour yoga session, we had a great breakfast by the sea. the service strives to be excellent but some junior staff does not really know how to serve properly. the view and atmosphere are amazing. the quality of the coffee could be improved for that price. overall excellent experience"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/djchrisblue", "user_id": "djchrisblue", "user_name": "djchrisblue", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Singapore, Singapore", "user_nb_contributions": 296.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 89.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 198.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Like a Local;Thrill Seeker;Nightlife Seeker"}, "history": [{"id": "7011560", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d719852-Reviews-Pur_Jean_Francois_Rouquette-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "review_date": "January 11, 2014", "review_city": "Paris, France", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "excellent experience", "review": "great dining experience if you can afford it. the 6-course dinner is lovely. french cuisine at its best."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 5.0}}]}}, {"id": "701157", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15210931-Reviews-The_Source_Cafe-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "December 24, 2018", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Very nice place", "review": "Stopped here for breakfast and we were really pleasantly surprised by the airy place, with excellent service, tasty food and coffee and reasonable prices."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ShareKhan4", "user_id": "Sameer D", "user_name": "ShareKhan4", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Singapore, Singapore", "user_nb_contributions": 499.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 335.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 283.0, "user_nb_photos": 623.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;History Buff;Nature Lover;Beach Goer"}, "history": [{"id": "7011570", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d10069292-Reviews-Try_Me-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "December 22, 2018", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Good food", "review": "My wife and I had fish amok and watermelon juice here for lunch.

The food was excellent, the crowd pleasant, the service attentive, and the atmosphere simple yet cute. A summary of our experience is bulleted below:  KEY COMMENTS  - Excellent food!  - Market pricing relative to other comparable options (although I think it's a better deal when you figure in the large size of the set lunch compared to other lunch options out there)  - Attentive service. Look is we had spent $50 per head and a uber fancy restaurant then my opinion in this case would be different. But the students were extremely attentive (albeit a bit inexperienced as you should fully expect).  - Cute yet very simple restaurant that is part patio and part open air inside of house. All ground floor. Very simple yet cute. It was a little warm but that was to be expected on a hot humid day in May.  - Largely an expat crowd which was amiable and appeared to be regulars for the most part. I really like places that are heavily frequented by regulars. And Sala Bai is definately enjoying support from the local expat crowd which is a both necessary and great.  - Great cause. I love love love what this restaurant and training school is doing.

We had arrived from the States a bit too early to check into our room, in the hotel - but this was no surprise, as we had to take a flight out of LAX, rather than SFO, so knew we would be at least an hour - or two - early. That was not to be helped. We did the formalities, and told the reservations agent that we would just find some Champagne in the Park Room.  On this early Spring afternoon, it was as lovely, as I remembered it to be, with sunlight streaming through the windows, overlooking Park Lane, and Hyde Park. This is an elegant room, there is no denying, but it is also a very comfortable room, at least it was for us.  We were seated by the welcoming hostess, at a nice little 2-top, in the main dining area. While not against the windows, we still had a lovely view. From my previous experience, I believe that the dining area, at those windows, is most often used for Afternoon Tea, as it has much more of a salon feel, and look to it. We were in the main dining area, just behind that salon.  We had the wine list in hand, and settled in to relax, enjoy ourselves, and await our room assignment - knowing that we probably had at least an hour, or more.  We started with Perrier-Jou\u00ebt Blanc de Blanc, and a glass of the Perrier-Jou\u00ebt Blason Ros\u00e9. Both were served in lovely flutes.  We sipped, and relaxed, as we had been flying for quite some time, and when the Champagne was gone, moved on to Soellner Gr\u00fcner Veltliner Fumburg \u201816 (a new wine to me), and the Henri de Villamont Meursault \u201815 (also a new producer - we were having fun now).  About half of the way through the still whites, our reservations agent arrived, and offered to show us to our suite, as soon as we had finished the wine. She made certain to give our server the room number, for the charges, which was a nice touch, as we did not need to bother with a credit card.  The afternoon had almost slipped by, and the wait was of no issue. We were in a lovely room, watching Hyde Park across the way, with excellent, and very friendly and attentive service, plus getting to explore some new wines. What a great way to start a holiday. I am so glad that my wife finally got to experience The Park Room, and now it was time to unpack, shower, and head back down to the lobby for dinner - with even more wine!"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/The_Loup_Garou", "user_id": "The_Loup_Garou", "user_name": "The_Loup_Garou", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "65+", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Phoenix, Arizona", "user_nb_contributions": 373.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 931.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 777.0, "user_nb_photos": 686.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;History Buff;60+ Traveler"}, "history": [{"id": "7012130", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1017662-Reviews-The_Park_Room-London_England.html", "review_date": "September 22, 2020", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Back for the Wines in a Beautiful Venue", "review": "Back for the Wines in a Beautiful Venue  We first discovered The Park Room at the JW Marriott Grosvenor House Park Lane Mayfair/London, when waiting for an event, with the Arizona Cardinals NFL Football team. They were in London for a game, and were using the JW Marriott as their base of operations. I then have returned several more times, and been impressed each time. In December, we were back to London, and on a totally leisure trip. We were staying just down Park Lane from the JW Marriott, and my wife asked if we could go to The Park Room for drinks. Well, that was a no-brainer - wines with my wife, with no meetings looming over her head, in a lovely space, just blocks from us. Off we went.  Now, there are three areas of The Park Room, and two are mostly attached, plus a lounge area, just around the corner, with a grand piano, which is more open to the reception area of the lobby. We were seated in the lounge area, near the piano, and I had the wine list in hand quickly. On this afternoon, the pianist was playing, and I think that this is only the second time, when he has been there - quite, quite good! Though the main dining room is gorgeous, one of the things that I like about the lounge area is that it has more of an open view of the attractive lobby - though no views out onto Park Lane, as that main dining area has.  We did the Henri de Villamont Clos Du Cromin Meursault \u201813, the Guillaume Vrignaud Fourchaume Chablis 1er Cru \u201815, and the Spelt \u201cLa Valentina\u201d Montepulciano D\u2019Abruzzo Riserva DOC \u201814. The wine service was great, but while the stemware was attractive (those are Park Room \u201csignature glasses\u201d), I was not that big a fan of the open bowl design - lovely to look at, but not my favorite for wines.  It\u2019s now a tossup, whether I like the main dining room, or this little lounge area the better, but that might depend on whether the pianist is playing. We will be returning, as we have since making this discovery, a few years back.

About half of the way through the still whites, our reservations agent arrived, and offered to show us to our suite, as soon as we had finished the wine. She made certain to give our server the room number, for the charges, which was a nice touch, as we did not need to bother with a credit card.  The afternoon had almost slipped by, and the wait was of no issue. We were in a lovely room, watching Hyde Park across the way, with excellent, and very friendly and attentive service, plus getting to explore some new wines. What a great way to start a holiday. I am so glad that my wife finally got to experience The Park Room, and now it was time to unpack, shower, and head back down to the lobby for dinner - with even more wine!"}}, "output": {"review_rating": 5.0}}]}}, {"id": "701214", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1223683-d2459474-Reviews-Sea_Fire_Salt_Anantara_Mai_Khao_Phuket_Villas-Mai_Khao_Thalang_District_Phuket.html", "review_date": "January 2, 2018", "review_city": "Phuket, Thailand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Very Disappointing!", "review": "I will start with the setting, which was lovely. Outside dining with blue and white tones, over looking the ocean (if you are there before sunset). Their online reservation system is VERY broken. We had a reservation for New Year\u2019s Eve (we received an email confirmation) but when we showed up, they had no record of it. They informed us that they were not doing the menu that night and sent us on our way - where are you supposed to find another restaurant at 9 pm on New Year\u2019s Eve? We decided to try again on January 2nd. Again made reservations online...and received an email confirmation. Got to the restaurant and they had no record of the reservation...at least this time they accommodated us. As I said before, a lovely setting. Our waiter had some struggles providing us with accurate menu information (actually was inaccurate on his description of several menu items) and overall the service was fair at best. If you are looking at their menu online - DON\u2019T! It is not the same....and the menu at the restaurant was not descriptive - hard to know what you were going to get. We saw nothing served on a salt block. I am wondering if they have changed management or the menu compared to previous reviews - usually Trip Advisor is a good reflection of a restaurant- but not this time - look only at recent pictures and reviews! Most items were very overpriced! We had Tiger Prawn Cocktail - it was only 2 (two!) prawns and cost 750 Bhat! They were good, but really? We ordered two bottles of wine that were listed in the menu for 1700 bhat and we were charged 2000 bhat per bottle! As for main dishes- the ribeye was fair at best, the scallops were 4 scallops - very tender but otherwise very average...the best dish we had was the blue swimmer crab - 4 crabs, very tasty but a lot of work to eat. The Parmesan mashed potatoes were good, enough for two people. The Lobster Mac and Cheese? Not an accurate description at all...it was more of a pasta in a lobster bisque - no cheese to speak of. We ordered asparagus - sorry, they were out. So, I don\u2019t usually tell people to avoid a restaurant - but we had much better meals and experiences in Phuket- eat elsewhere!"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Michelle112013", "user_id": "Michelle112013", "user_name": "Michelle112013", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Indianapolis, Indiana", "user_nb_contributions": 309.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 155.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 133.0, "user_nb_photos": 207.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Urban Explorer;Nature Lover;Peace and Quiet Seeker"}, "history": [{"id": "7012140", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1223683-d3356949-Reviews-Ginja_Taste-Mai_Khao_Thalang_District_Phuket.html", "review_date": "February 11, 2018", "review_city": "Phuket, Thailand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Cooking Class at Ginja Cook - a highlight!", "review": "Several of our family members participated in the morning cooking school at Ginja Taste.

The best time would be for a morning trip to the pool.  The staff are friendly and welcoming.  The restaurant has a 100K min spend. To sit by the pool on a lounger there is a 150K min spend.  The bathrooms are very clean and tidy.  The meals are reasonably priced and decent sizes.  The pool areas is relaxing and peaceful surrounded by nature, blue colours and the sound of birds / a waterfall.  I ordered a tuna steak on ciabatta. Unfortunately the ciabatta was about a day old & the tuna was very dry. Given the bread wasn\u2019t fresh, it make me slightly concerned the fish might not be either. But nevertheless it was a good value meal for 82K. It also came with fries which was unexpected (the menu didn\u2019t say this). Unfortunately the fries hadn\u2019t been cooked long enough and were still that processed harder raw potato in the middle. The fries would be yummier with salt.  I ordered a fruit salad which had a great variety of fruit including banana, strawberries, rock melon, water melon, and delish tasty apple!! It came with yougert, (granola on the top to my surprise) and lime. The bailenese honey was nice and lime flavoured (not too sweet!). The fruit salad could be improved with more lime, dragon fruit included  It would be nice if the menu ultilised the cheaper local sourced ingredients more - ie. the salmon steak at 210K Could be switched to a seared tuna loin at an affordable price around 15K.  It would also be nice if diary free nut milks were available for the coffee.  I would also suggest lowering the price of the fresh young coconut (even at top beach clubs they don\u2019t seem to reach the 50K mark).  I would also suggest the option of adding sides to the breakfasts - especially a side of avo.  The menu could cater better to vegetarians and vegans or healthy eaters by allowing \u201ca make your own\u201d with sides option.  Overall, really impressed with the local and great taste decor. Will be coming back and will recommend to others.

Service this year felt remarkably different. In the past we always received a gluten-free menu for my celiac husband without asking (I specify in my booking that he needs a gluten-free meal). This year we had to ask for it. I ordered a cocktail and my husband an aperitif. Before we even received them, the waiter asked if we wanted to order our meal. I don't think I have ever had that happen in a Michelin-starred restaurant. It felt like dining in a cafe. We said we would prefer to have our drinks and then order. In prior years we always looked forward to the mignardise at the end of the meal. They would always tell my husband which things he could have and fill in with macarons if too many of the usual mignardise had gluten. This time we noticed we were the only table that didn't receive any. We asked the waiter and he said that my husband would not be able to eat them (not true - they included macarons). I asked why did I not get any. He said he assumed that I would not want any if my husband could not have any. That's like saying I would not eat bread at a meal if he couldn't have any. We asked for a manager and he apologized and we got our mignardise. I gave my husband ones that I knew were OK for him and they obviously were since he had no effect from them. The manager gave us his card and assured us that next time he would make sure we were properly taken care of. These are small things, and the cocktail and food and wine were excellent, but we have been here quite a number of times before and the the service was flawless and friendly in the past to the point where a waiter we had on an earlier visit would come over and say hello. Also, it does have a Michelin star and you should not have to worry about anything in such a restaurant.

We started with shrimp and a fried spinach appetizers, both were fantastic. For entrees, we sampled a nice cross section of dishes, including shrimp, vegetarian, chicken and lamb. The highlight entree was the \u201cK\u201d special platter with a mixed grill of lamb and chicken cooked in different styles. Several flavors of naan bread rounded out our entrees.

They must have run out of zucchini flowers (already at 1:30pm) because there were none. My wife had the wild boar meatballs with porcini mushrooms and truffles. Both meals were okay, but not top notch Italian/Sicilian. They have very few Sicilian wines, and a lot of Tuscan / Piedmontese, which is probably understandable in the US. Sicily does have a lot of great wine producers so perhaps they aren't available here. They did have one Planeta rose, which is good, but for a popular choice Plumbago would be good.

There is a small bar area at the front of the restaurant where you can have a pre-dinner drink. We did this last night but I would not necessarily say this is essential.

The samosas were very tasty indeed, the squash soup was tasteless and the colic cauliflower was surprisingly tasty (that from colleague who dislikes cauliflower). Main course: the briani was ok; the lamb ragon josh was not curried enough(I asked for very spicy); the naan was bad enough that a true blooded Indian would not have touched it. The masala was ok but not curried enough; the vindaloo was good (but that is coming from a Texan who is used to Mac n cheese).  After we finished the main course we waited 25 min for the waiter to take away the dishes (after we called over the hostess). Another 20 min to order desert.

There are 3 levels - the bottom level is the busiest since it is near the bar and kitchen. The 2nd level is smaller and intimate and the top level is reserved for larger parties.  We sat on the 2nd level and it was easy to have a conversation amid the hubub of the other patrons. Our waiter was very attentive and able to answer any & all questions. There was a separate waiter who took care of our water and wine needs.  My friend and I took advantage of the Prix Fixe menu by ordering the french onion soup, mussels, ravioli with mushrooms and chicken paillard. The only dish that was not enjoyable was the chicken - it was very dry and lacked taste. The onion soup was to die for, as were the mussels and the ravioli melted in my mouth.

We came to Paris for a week, to celebrate my beloved's 50th birthday. I did some research in advance, and decided that this will be the place.  First thanks go to Mariana, who communicated with me in advance of the visit. Professional, prompt to reply, working with us on the 6-course menu (we don't eat meat), adjusting it to our food preferences and the special touches for the celebration.  Then came the evening. Professional welcome, with elegance and grace. Once we got seated, we met James the sommelier. Unbelievably knowledgeable about wines and the profession at large. A delicious glass of champagne to start the evening, followed by an even more divine French red - to die for. On top of it, because we had fish, he recommended - and brought (on the house) - two glasses of white that fit the dish perfectly.  The service from the whole team was superb. SUPERB! Luc was equally professional and friendly, and we engaged in a few conversations about how they run the place, and the world of Michelin stars.  Then came dessert. Or, more specifically, first came the pre-dessert dish. It was followed by two separate dessert dishes, wrapping everything with a chocolate creation of one of the chefs who specializes in chocolate.  We have both \"been around\" and traveled various parts of the world, separate and together - and experienced a variety of restaurants. We unanimously agreed that this was THE BEST restaurant experience of our lives! Sure, it was also the most expensive one - and I would pay it again for this experience, without thinking twice.

It\u2019s as if every night is a playoff game and everyone is gunning for the title. Here, a Michelin Star might actually be worth more than in other cities. And if you\u2019re lucky enough to be on vacation, with back-to-back dinners at this level, you would imagine that someone has to lose. It was with this pressure we dined at Pur, having just experienced newly starred Saturne the night before.  Would there be space for its unique take on starred excellence?  Pur is a classic fine dining experience. This is not a let down. Imagine the finest ingredients in unique combinations. Now imagine them served at a level that take six dishes and create wonderful arc.  While identifying individual dishes is useless as Chef Aie Okabayashi is sure to adjust the menu based on what\u2019s seasonal, the one prevailing taste we encountered was \u201csmoke\u201d. Similar to the essence of barbecue, there were hits of smoke and wood in unexpected delicate places like fish. Yes there was a duck course that was one of the best\u2026the skin by alone could have been a delicacy.  Lest we forget, two of the six courses were desserts, with a palate cleanser that could be a dish in itself. Actually, the that cleaner tart \u201csouffl\u00e9\u201d was probably our favorite, and the pastry chef, who busily prepped dishes all night next to our chef\u2019s table, humbly admitted it was his as well.  We opted not to commit to the wine pairings, but the Sancerre and Margeux by the glass were excellent. If you prefer cocktails, their take on the Moscow Mule is worth the price. And don\u2019t be intimidated by the six-courses. It\u2019s the right size and takes about three hours, so it was well-paced.  Finally, the service was superb. It doesn\u2019t hurt that we were seated at the chef\u2019s table with a window into the kitchen where Chef was making sure no detail was overlooked. And yes she made one trainee remake a simple amuse-bouche simply because he failed to sprinkle the dust in the right direction. And an anniversary cake for a couple celebrating theirs was reset because it sat a few minutes too long.  Situated in the sexy Park Hyatt Vendome, this is far more than a \u201chotel\u201d restaurant. It\u2019s epic\u2026they brought their A-game on an average Tuesday evening. But hey, this is Paris, and the next Michelin wannabe is right around the corner!  The good news is that Pur has the goods, elegance and fine creations, to keep that star shining."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/brownboynyc", "user_id": "brownboynyc", "user_name": "brownboynyc", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Brooklyn, New", "user_nb_contributions": 57.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 90.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 90.0, "user_nb_photos": 9.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Urban Explorer;Shopping Fanatic"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "701332", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255122-d725999-Reviews-The_Bunker_Restaurant-Queenstown_Otago_Region_South_Island.html", "review_date": "June 27, 2018", "review_city": "Queenstown, New Zealand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Worth the wait", "review": "Casually walked in early with no booking had to return in a hour after a bit more shopping to get one of only 8 tables.

For mains I had the duck while my wife had the Venison which was the better of the 2 & other diners at a nearby table also agreed. We did not order dessert as we had a reasonably large & late lunch. I am gluten free but chef has plenty of options, also a non drinker, great mocktail options also available. A little noisy with the small room size but cosy & warm with the inside wood fire.

We were greeted and seated in a most professional way, and the staff were lovely and friendly as always. Now for the best part - THE FOOD! I had the raw fish salad for my entr\u00e9e and it was so unbelievably delicious that we went back numerous times and I always ordered the same entr\u00e9e. My husband fell in love with the prawn Caesar salad, which is huge for an entr\u00e9e. We tried something different every time for a main and everything we tried was just beautiful. The service staff are very attentive and the prices are very reasonable. All money goes towards their training program, which has a 100% success rate of placing graduates. Located only a couple of minutes out of town by tuk tuk ($6 for a return trip is heaps), it is well worth it. The restaurant area is located in the upstairs part of the building and it is lovely and cool. I can not praise Sala Bai, it's food and it's staff enough. Do yourself a favour and visit.

For example: You don\u2019t even have to keep asking for iced water, there is always someone walking around pouring everyone a cold drink of water. They also have popsicles in the morning for the young ones. And this afternoon, my daughter met a little accident while running and had small scratches on her knees. Immediately, there was a resort staff to attend to her wound. Truly appreciated! Food and cocktails are delicious! We\u2019ve certainly had more than our fair share of mango daiquiris in between dips in the pool. Now, the beach just a few steps down is gorgeous especially on a warm sunny day!

Need Better Desserts (3.5 Stars).", "review": "During my stay in Paris, I wanted to have at least one fine dining experience. I chose Pur' since it was a Michelin starred restaurant and they were open on a Sunday. Many French restaurants are closed on Sundays, so I was happy to find a one that was open. You should make a reservation. If I remember correctly, I think I made mine about a month in advance. The restaurant is located in the Hyatt hotel.  The ambiance is very nice. Typical of many hotel restaurants. However, it had a more loungey, but classy, feel which I found relaxing and nice. I liked the lounge like seating as opposed to rows of tables and chairs.  Come dressed nice - you do not have to be too formal - no gowns. But dress as you would when you go to a special occasion at church or formal work function.  I had the 6 course pre-fixe with wine pairings which included:  - Monkfish, Fennel, and Sweet Potato dish - Duck Foie Gras with Green Beans, and Quinoa in a Yogurt/Horseradish Sauce - Beef with Potatoes - A few dessert dishes  The staff was very accommodating to my friends peanut allergy, so I am unsure if the selections are in line with what they actual offer on their menu. I let them know during the reservation period and when we got there, they were very attentive to ensure that they met our dietary needs. In general, the service was superb. I feel confident in saying that it was the best service I had in Paris. Very professional and polite staff.  The wine pairings were superb. Everything paired well nicely. I did not like the port with dessert. However, that is not held against the restaurant as port is considered a dessert drink. I personally just don't care for port. Especially not with dessert. Not sure where that rule was established. lol.  I was a huge fan of all the entrees. It is very difficult for me to pick a favorite. I guess I would have to say the Monkfish. However, the Duck Foie Gras and Beef were cooked perfectly. I loved the layers of flavors. They were hearty without being heavy. They were nicely presented as well. The entrees itself would give this restaurant a 5 stars.  I gave 3.5 tar because of the desserts. I did not care much for the desserts. In fact, I do not think I really remember any of them. They consisted a big portion of the meal (8 in total I think). I do think I had a dessert with brie - and I remember eating it. This says a lot because no one can get me to eat brie. I usually do not have the pallet for it (it's possible it wasn't brie). But generally, the desserts were not memorable.  As an American, and this being my first fine dining experience of this caliber, it was difficult for me to get used to the tiny food. I am big into nutrition, and technically, the food is perfect portion sizes. However, it didn't prevent me from wanting a juicy turkey burger afterwards. I did not leave full.  I stopped at the restaurant bar after dinner. They had some very unique cocktails. I ordered the \"Puki Puki\" simply because I liked the name. It was a very beautiful and tastey cocktail. Very tastey cocktail - more memorable than the dinner wine. I vote that all restaurants should offer cocktail pairings with pre-fixe dinner. That would be nice!  The 6-course pre-fixe will run you about 235 Euro - not bad considering some other fine dining resteraunts were almost double."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/travelhoneyBL", "user_id": "Courtney T", "user_name": "Courtney T", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "25-34", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Frederick, Maryland", "user_nb_contributions": 64.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 59.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 31.0, "user_nb_photos": 185.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Urban Explorer;Like a Local"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "701377", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d3318261-Reviews-Shanghai_Asian_Cuisine-New_York_City_New_York.html", "review_date": "April 3, 2013", "review_city": "New York City, United States", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Perfect!", "review": "Good and fast service, delicious food, a big variety of dishes, good prices! they have two restaurants in china town, very close one-another."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EUcitizenTravelling", "user_id": "EUcitizenTravelling", "user_name": "EUcitizenTravelling", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Athens, Greece", "user_nb_contributions": 66.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 37.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 64.0, "user_nb_photos": 6.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Urban Explorer;Like a Local"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "701378", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293734-d2103638-Reviews-Pepe_Nero-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html", "review_date": "February 20, 2018", "review_city": "Marrakech, Morocco", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Ok but...", "review": "Hard to get a reservation.

We had some sushi, wagyu, chateaubriand, scallops and lobster tail along with various vegetables with some rice. All of which were excellent and, needless to say, served piping hot. The chef cooks this all in front of you on the hot plate and does a little show with the various ingredients - onions become a chimney, spells out words with the rice, etc., Service was attentive and the staff were very pleasant.

The homemade foie gras I choose was delicious but slightly overpriced. 21 Euros for one single slice is too much. Even at Michelin rated restaurants the portion would be better.

Great Praline mousse, nice chocolate sphere, nice crumble combination. It was death of chocolate, a very nice one. So let me begin with the starter. The champignons de bois had an excellent taste, an amazing texture. The salad topping was not mine, but all in a bite very good. The main course was an Argentine Entrecote, cooked to perfection. All these dishes are presented in a good manner at a nice location. The ambiance is great, following the theme of this restaurant. The host and the staff in general: keen, nice, helpful and attentive. Nothing to complain about and to be honest: we ate worse at Michelin Star restaurants. The location of the restaurant cannot be found without TripAdvisor. Hence, no mass tourism and no tourists who want to eat cheap and fast. We had a great evening and an absolutely fantastic dinner.

Well done. I finished that meal with a Cafe Gourmet which was a good choice.

There were two small tables on the ground floor with the main open kitchen behind them. On the first floor there were10 small tables for 4 people each.  Be prepared to wait a while as the food is freshly prepared. It is worth the wait as the food is delicious. I have been there on two occasions and on both time there was only one waitress who spoke very good English and was rushed off her feet. The local dish which I chose called Tajine was lovely. I chose a Tajine chicken which had fresh vegetables - runner beans, potatoes, carrots, olives (photo enclosed). This was my first Moroccan dish and I was not disappointed.  On the second time I had a freshly made pizza and it was just as enjoyable as the traditional Moroccan dish. Everything on it was fresh and it tasted wonderful. It tasted better than the ones that I had in Rome and Sicily.  This little restaurant gets very busy. I would highly recommend going early as possible otherwise there can be an hour waiting time. Diners do seem to be in a hurry to leave.

We were greeted and seated in a most professional way, and the staff were lovely and friendly as always. Now for the best part - THE FOOD! I had the raw fish salad for my entr\u00e9e and it was so unbelievably delicious that we went back numerous times and I always ordered the same entr\u00e9e. My husband fell in love with the prawn Caesar salad, which is huge for an entr\u00e9e. We tried something different every time for a main and everything we tried was just beautiful. The service staff are very attentive and the prices are very reasonable. All money goes towards their training program, which has a 100% success rate of placing graduates. Located only a couple of minutes out of town by tuk tuk ($6 for a return trip is heaps), it is well worth it.

The restaurant is through another door and has the exact same qualities. Really really well thought out. The food is simple and from a manageable menu. A had the beef fillet. It was tender and juicy. Lots of flavour. The only thing I would say is maybe more vegetables with it. All that really accompanied it was pur\u00e9ed potato. My partner had the lamb shank. It was a good portion and full of flavour but again, maybe adding more vegetables as it was only accompanied by potato pur\u00e9e. For dessert we had tiramisu and apple pie.

Lovely decor and presentation, but the food somehow just doesn't live up to expectations. We have traveled to India and are frequent diners at the small places in Edison, NJ (little India) -- places where you get wow (but definitely NOT atmosphere cheap). Utsav is very convenient to theaters, and has a prix fixe menu. We did a combo of small plates, entrees and dessert. The small plates were both excellent -- traditional samosas and a quinoa potato patty. The mains less so. The menu has a combination of traditional and different, and my husband's Baingan Bharta (eggplant) was enjoyable. I had the Shrimp Goa, which was supposed to come in a coconut sauce. It was basically Shrimp Tikka Masala, and it was overcooked. I mean to the point of tough. I've had that issue in Indian places before, but that is a rookie mistake to be sure. Short on time I did not send it back, but also did not love it. The dessert was again quite good, a traditional kheer but with coconut sorbet in the middle. The entire meal cost $150 for 3 people (tax and tip included -- no alcohol). In Edison it's usually about $65 and we have tons left over.

So I was delighted when a friend suggested that a group of us should go to Chamisse this week. It is a very good restaurant, most of the team are Lebanese and the welcome is warm.  The setting is very simple, which is fine: the focus is always on the food. We chose to have a selection of mezzo and a selection of grills placed down the table so that the group of 20 could chat and eat contentedly without making choices. This is where Lebanese food it as its best, being shared by everybody with a little bit of this and more of that up and down the table. Small dishes flowed in (kebbeh, kellaj, fatayr, hummus, mfassack, tabbouleh, fattoush, loubieh bel zeit, labneh, moutabbel and more besides) and all tasted very good. My only comment was that some of the flavours were slightly blander than I like but they were very good. In particular the kebbeh was as good as I have tasted (deliciously moist in the middle and crunchy on the outside) and the labneh was wonderfully subtle. So definitely 4 plus for the food.  Very good service too. The team were there to look after us very well throughout, making sure the dishes moved along, that glasses were full and that everyone was enjoying themselves. Not intrusive but we did benefit from their attention throughout.  What more can I say - I look forward to returning."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}]}}, {"id": "701558", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d10226588-Reviews-Restaurant_Pepr_a_Sul-Prague_Bohemia.html", "review_date": "February 27, 2019", "review_city": "Prague, Czech Republic", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Amazing in EVERY regard!", "review": "Found this gem based on TA reviews and could not be more pleased.

So it's out of necessity and convenience that we had our daily buffet breakfast in this restaurant. And we are very happy we did. Food offers and spreads are great.For starters, they had so many appetisers and soups including their culinary masterpiece and favourite Tom Yang. This time it's on the light side version as against the heavy soup that is typically served. Great variety of Japanese and international cuisine : bacon, sausages, ham, omelletes,sushi bar, salad bar, desserts: local fruits like dragon fruit, pineapple,jackfruit, etc. A great way to start the day of beautiful memories. Of course, one can also order a la carte for set breakfast menus which in itself is very generous in serving size.

We had a bowl of bread with 3 different kinds of fresh and slightly warm bread. It was accompanied by a herb spread which had nice, subtle flavours and a perfect temperature. I wanted more bread! But thank God they didn\u2019t give me any (I didn't ask for it), because we were all completely full, when we left the restaurant a couple of hours later. The amuse bouche was delicate foam of smoked potatoes. There were some crunchy bits on top and a bit of sour notes from tiny pieces of pickled vegetables as well. These 2 elements gave some texture, and it was a brilliant little dish. The starter was smoked char with almond milk \u201ccaviar\u201d, beluga lentils, horseradish, and marjoram. The trout had a firm, yet tender texture and had received just the right amount of smoke. The subtle horseradish sauce with marjoram complimented both fish and lentils very well and made everything come together. The lentils were perfectly cooked \u2013 I am not sure if \u201cal dente\u201d is a way to describe lentils, but I\u2019ll risk it. The almond milk caviar was mainly on the plate for texture, I believe \u2013 it didn\u2019t pack a lot of flavour. I like that the \u201ceggs\u201d had different sizes. That worked well visually and also when it came to the texture. The size of the portion was generous \u2013 we all agreed that it wouldn\u2019t have been strange at all, if they had served one piece of trout instead of the two nice portions on our plates. The main dish was veal rib eye, beans, dried beef, beets, cashews, and demi glace. We were given a choice how we would like our meat prepared, and we all chose medium. Mine was closer to medium rare, and that was perfectly fine with me. The first impression of the dish came from tasting the demi glace, which was one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. Only the master of sauces, Steven Trumpfheller, has served me a better one. So rich and full of flavour and reduced to the point where it would make my lips stick together. The steak was tender and well seasoned, and it hade more and deeper flavour than I would have expected from veal \u2013 more like a young bull. There were 3 different types of beans on the side, all cooked to perfection. The beets added an earthy and sweet/sour dimension, and the small bites of smoked and dried beef held it together, although my first bite was very tough (the rest weren\u2019t). Just as it was the case with the starter, everything on the plate created a perfect combination, and the dish was quite filling. I regretted not having saved a slice of bread to wipe my plate clean with. Not to embarrass my two friends at the table I decided not to lick the sauce off my plate, but the thought crossed my mind. The dessert was macaroon in two ways, cherry, chocolate, tangerine, and basil garnished with raspberries and a blackberry. The macaroon on the side was good, but to me the star of the dish was the clever composition in the middle. I tried tasting the different elements individually, and they went almost all the way around the palate, except for saltiness. Sweet, sour, tart, bitter. And then when they all met in combination with the chewy and a little bit gooey macaroon bottom, it was simply a heavenly mouthful. The menu mentions a pre-dessert as a palate cleanser. Previously it has been a ball of sorbet. They forgot to serve it at our table, but they found out and insisted that we had coffee on the house, accompanied with cute cubes of chocolaty caramel. It was a nice finish to our meal. The service was friendly and attentive, and we were given plenty of time between dishes, which we really appreciate. We were served by different waiters, but the manager always kept an eye on our table and checked every once in a while if we were happy \u2013 and it was a pleasure chatting with him. Hospitality must lie in his genes. We agreed that this final festival experience was a perfect ending to this year\u2019s adventure as a group \u2013 and most definitely we\u2019re looking forward to repeating it next year! There are 2 seats left for the Restaurant festival at Ml\u00fdnec this year: 1 seat on the 12/2 at 17:30 and 1 on the 16/2 at 17:30.

It's served on Saturdays and Sundays between 11:30-15:00. The menu changes from week to week. The price is Czk. 1.290, - per person. It includes prosecco, red wine, white wine, beer, coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice and other soft drinks ad libitum. My boss, who is pretty awesome - and has asked me out several times this week - is in Prague with her husband, and I thought it appropriate to ask them out, just once. We usually attend the Grand Restaurant Festival together, but that\u2019s not an option this year. Instead we\u2019ve designed our own culinary week. The menu we had yesterday is below. Food is served at the table. We were given dishes to share, and we were pleased with the portion sizes, which allowed us to taste everything. By the time we had done that, we were also absolutely stuffed. Everything we were served was impressively delicious. The praise came in a stream from all three of us. We were impressed with the quality of the prosecco and wines included in what was effectively an all-you-can-drink package. The service was also absolutely perfect. The team of waiters were quite young and they were well trained in the profession, they were polite, friendly, helpful and had both humour and the courage to bring their personalities to work. When we arrived at 11:30, we discussed whether we could have arrived a little later and still had plenty of time before 15:00. But the service was kind enough to give us plenty of time between courses, we had a good time - and by 14:35 we were ready for dessert, which by the way was a feast of flavours and textures and one of the many highlights of the brunch.

In fact, it has been quite some time since I have experienced such a high standard of service coupled with a an exceptional good meal.  Caviar is obviously well represented on the menu and if you like caviar, I can certainly recommend it as you will not be disappointed. The caviar is exceptional as either a taster or within the menu where it is an integral part of the meal.  For those that enjoy caviar, you will appreciate the difference between what is typically a more production style caviar to something that is far more refined and as such far more pleasurable for the pallet.  While the restaurant is not inexpensive for Paris, the price is certainly in line with both the exceptional food and service - well done !  Would I return ?

It's just a few minutes walk away from the Basilica Cistern and the Hippodrome and accessed through the And Hotel lobby.  When I arrived, there was nobody else in the restaurant, so the service was rapid and attentive. However, the dish I picked from the menu was off and I was steered towards one of the specials instead.  When this arrived, it was fine - a lamb dish - but I didn't much like the bed of sauce and vegetables it was on - but this is probably my problem as I'm not a big fan of vegetables!

Each dish was flawless, although the Mackerel dish was a little too fishy for our taste. (Our mistake for never having had Mackerel before.) The Octopus was delicious; tender and perfect. The Bossam (pork belly rice) was beautifully porky without being greasy. The Sea Bream was delicate and flavorful. I would recommend the Galbi (pork ribs), but you can also have them on W 32nd probably just as good but not on such a pretty plate. The desserts were works of art that were as tasty as they were beautiful. The Jang Dok were little kimchi pots made of ganache which was a nice way for the chef to tell his story. Likewise for the Harubang, by far the prettiest plate. I wish there was a little bit more light so we could have enjoyed the beauty of these plates. Wine list is excellent.

The restaurant send great directions but if you're a little nervous about finding Pepe Nero they will send someone out to the square to collect you.  The food was delicious and the service was perfect. We chose from both the Moroccan and Italian menus and our friends agreed this was a real gem of a place. Great atmosphere, food and service and the prices are amazing.  So glad we came back and having informed the restaurant at the time of booking that it was our anniversary they supplied a lovely complimentary cake at the end of our meal.

We had choices to make: we could consume our order at the picnic tables outside the store; or we could have our order delivered to our accommodation for an additional $8 or we could pre-order and pick up (takeaway?) the meal package at a prearranged time. We opted for the last choice. We had time therefore to explore the Skyline Gondola prior to our return and mealtime. When we returned, our order was not yet ready so we had time to go across the street to the grocery and acquire \"happy hour\" and salad fixings. Returning to our \"home,\" we dined. The meat literally fell off the bone. It was moist, tender, and delicious. The potatoes were fully cooked but firm and not mushy. It was sufficiently abundant to feed 4 hungry adults.

I think, when we dined here previously (many years ago) that we had our meal on the upper level where the bar now is. I was keen to try some cocktails and was told that not all cocktails made in the bar were available in the restaurant and I wasn't sure why but that's ok. I did have 2 very nice cocktails whilst there (pink diamond and a dessert cocktail as I had no room for dessert after the amazing entree and main). Both myself and my husband had the Paua entree which was sublime and we then had mains as follows: Hubby had the beef which was divine and I had the duck which was exquisite. I can't recall the exact side dishes we had but we had 2 and they complemented our mains beautifully. Wine: the wine list was good but not amazing and somewhere as 'exclusive' as The Bunker should have a better selection IMHO."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/kristabel2016", "user_id": "kristabel2016", "user_name": "kristabel2016", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Napier, New", "user_nb_contributions": 410.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 59.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 196.0, "user_nb_photos": 114.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Shopping Fanatic;Nature Lover"}, "history": [{"id": "7016460", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255122-d726702-Reviews-Public_Kitchen_Bar-Queenstown_Otago_Region_South_Island.html", "review_date": "March 11, 2021", "review_city": "Queenstown, New Zealand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Still rocking...", "review": "I have recently been in Queenstown with my husband and another couple after walking the Routeburn Track.

It was more of a rather dull fusion of sashimi and ceviche. As a whole the ceviche was ok, but it was definitely lame.  The place was packed with tourist (I believe only two French speakers) which is always a bad sign. When I left they asked me to review at TripAdvisor, which I tend to do quite often. However, places that ask their customers for reviews are seldom very good in my experience.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "7016818", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

In general the Argentinians know how when it comes to steaks but Luis just took it up a notch.  Luis and his team was great - making everyone feel at home and comfortable and Luis was even so kind to let guests turn the steaks and interact whilst preparing the food.  Everything was delicious and the setting beautiful in this 'secret loft' in Buenos Aires.

We were then offered a table further inside. When we went in it was right by the fire for the pizza!! We knew we was ordering the 29 inch pizza so ordered half and half. One half was pepperoni and ricotta and the other five cheese. We ordered a bottle of wine which was very nice. We were a little worried as the table we were on was small and the size of the pizzas going past wee huge bit when it was delivered it fitted on the edge but the board it came on was so sturdy we did t need to worry.

We liked to sit outside with the ocean view so they provided an ice bucket to keep our Singha beers cold. The extensive menu meant we never ate the same main course twice, though we always chose the same shared mixed starters. The Valentine's Day Meal was a particular triumph with an amazing variety of meat, vegetables and seafood, including lobster.  I was also lucky enough to be able to eat here for breakfast on a couple of mornings when they opened up as the hotel was very full. The Chef's Signature Eggs on smashed avocado, tomato salsa and sour dough served to the table with a fresh fruit smoothie and sparkling wine made a heavenly start to the day.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.  The points above wouldn\u2019t stop me from visiting again but there\u2019s room for improvement."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 3.0}}, {"id": "7017202", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d9861395-Reviews-Fresh_Fruit_Factory-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "April 12, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Not many choices for lunch but the choices they do have are tasty", "review": "The only choices for the mains is cold pasta.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "7017208", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

It really didn't matter because the staff didn't judge us on our appearance. They were extremely attentive and shared jokes with us. We got the porter house steak for 4, 2 of the 4 of us are very big eaters, so it made sense to do it this way The other 2 got the fillet steak and the fish. We devoured the steak in record time as it was cooked perfectly, medium rare, just how we like it. The sides are separate, so you just get the steak and you pivk the sides.

We ordered a margherita buffala pizza and pizza capriciossa. Both were really tasty. We love pizza napoletana and we eat it quite often when we are at home (we live next to the border with Italy) and these pizzas really were everything you would expect from a napoletan pizza. For dessert we had a cheesecake, which was really light, but tasted more like a whipped creme than cream cheese. It was still pretty good.

The service was friendly and engaging.Each member of the team was very knowledgeable and took time to answer any questions we had. Every dish was a taste explosion and it was impossible to choose a favourite. The complex flavours were the result of many processes beyond the means of even the most dedicated foodie. All the food was perfectly seasoned, creatively plated and, hot (one of my gripes at so many fine dining establishments).  This is probably the first review I have written where it is impossible to choose a stand out dish. All were perfectly executed.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "7017578", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

It\u2019s a cozy restaurant in Firostefani and an alternative to the caldera view restaurants because it relies on ambience and food more than caldera views. Certainly a very welcoming and helpful host and this place is rightly popular. We had booked in advance and that was a good job because there were many ad hoc visitors who had to be turned away as it was fully booked. The food is very homely and of a good standard. I am not sure where many reviewers below have dined but I would not consider the food rates as highly as many have described. Obviously tastes vary. We found it a very pleasant alternative though to many other places we visited in Santorini and it certainly comes at a significantly lower cost than pretty much anywhere with the view out over the caldera. Well worth a visit .

What was interesting is that unlike many of the other restaurants we went to during our trip to France, Aspic offered a wine pairing with the meal which was quite nice and added an extra layer to the experience.  Service was overall good but you need to go into this with the right expectation that this is a lean operation. As far as I could tell there was the chef in the kitchen and one waitress for about 12 tables. It didn't feel slow or anything but it wasn't \"high touch\" either.

Their response was they were very busy and this is indeed the time to make money. This is appalled us how can someone do this 2 hours before our booking. The restaurant were unhelpful and customer service was not top of their priority it was money for so called 20 kitchen staff and the time of the year and being busy. So if they were not busy they would have happily honoured our reservation without an issue.

I then had as a copious main course the shredded leg of lamb, potato puree, baked vegetables. I ended up with a lovely dessert: Baked yoghurt, plums, poppy seeds.  The restaurant has a nice selection of wines by the glass and an amazing list of wines (bottles). I had wine by the glass (being solo). I took a glass of white wine Sonberk 2017 (Chardonnay and Pinot gris) and for dessert a glass of Sonberk Palava 2016. Sonberk is the icon of Czech Republic\u00b4s winemaking. First time I tasted their wines but I loved it. I also found the cutlery rest very nicely designed.  After lunch, I had a tour of the beautiful wine cellar of the restaurant: amazing bottles! I had lunch in the covered patio overlooking the cobblestone courtyard. They have several little dining room, if you want a more intimate dinner. Opposite to the courtyard, they also have a building where they have the wine cellar as well as a dining room with a vaulted ceiling. They organize event of wine tasting there. Grand Cru was a lovely discovery with great food, friendly staff! Due to Covid, there were only few customers. However, I will definitely go again to Grand Cru when I return to Prague."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/MicheleParis", "user_id": "MicheleParis", "user_name": "MicheleParis", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Paris, France", "user_nb_contributions": 326.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 153.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 371.0, "user_nb_photos": 737.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;History Buff"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "701793", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d5501486-Reviews-Oliva_Nera_Ristorante_Italiano-Prague_Bohemia.html", "review_date": "July 7, 2019", "review_city": "Prague, Czech Republic", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Delicious Food, Great Service and Location", "review": "We came upon Oliva Nera in a small, quiet square, and away from the noisy crowds.

They made the reservation on our behalf and even escorted us to the restaurant - that is what I called 'good customer service'.  The Red Bean restaurant is situated at the foyer of the hotel and nicely laid out with a small bar. The ambience was good and the staff was attentive.  There is a lot to choose from the Menu, a combination of local Vietnamese and European food. As we have been in Hanoi for a few days and sampled quite a few local dishes, we decided to go for steak. We had tomato Rossini and fried vegetable spring rolls for our starters, followed by a tenderloin steak and a mushroom and aubergine claypot as our main courses. The food was gorgeous and very well presented. The portion size was just right for a fine dining. We had a flambe banana with ice cream and fresh fruit platter for our desserts.  We were not disappointed with the quality of food and service provided by yet another Le Siesta hotel which speaks volume for the Elegance Hotel Group. 3 of the EHG hotels have a Red Bean restaurants.  We were very pleased with our meal and thoroughly enjoyed our meal at the Red Bean and well done Le Siesta Diamond for recommending this restaurant.  Highly recommend that you give the Red Bean restaurant a go when you happen to be in the Old Quarter in Hanoi.

Leonel our attendant spoke good English so ordering was a breeze. Food and wine are so cheap and of such quality it really only comes down to what your taste buds are up for. Small glasses of Sav were the only disappointment, come on Sheraton catch up to other local restaurants who give you a proper size glass of wine. Anyway the MOW tucked into the biggest chargrilled octopus tentacle I have ever seen and I settled for the braised rabbit, both excellent and of large proportions. Just had to have an excellent red from the Cafayete region, much better than Mendoza reds. Mains were rabbit done in pastry and aged steak accompanied with sweetbreads, hmm not really me...Dessert was a grilled banana in its skin with a caramel sauce and a parfait, bloody delicious. Any way service slowed down as more people arrived and the staff were stretched, however they made up for it by providing an excellent champagne FOC.

When we had visited this restaurant, several years back, we were pleasantly surprised by the ambiance and quality of food.

We arrived with a lot of anticipation, but were utterly disappointed, by the time we left.  The restaurant started us of on the wrong foot, by stacking up unclean plates. Every plate we picked up (from the stack of plates provided) had food particles stuck to the bottom. Either their dishwasher was spoilt, or whoever was washing the dishes, did a shoddy job. I had to pick through at least 10 plates (supposedly clean) before getting hold of a \u201csomewhat clean plate\u201d.  At the Appetizer counter, there was a man preparing chat. I asked him for a helping, and was told that they will bring it to our table. By the time we left, no one had bothered to get us the chat.  The food quality was well below average, and not commensurate of a restaurant charging over $20/person for the buffet. There were very few items, both for the vegetarian and the non-vegetarian palate. The food tasted like \u201cproduction line\u201d preparation. There were two desert dishes that were clearly below par.  I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good Indian food.

Without asking us first, the guy on the door showed them straight to a table and when he then came back to welcome us, we then had to wait for about 10 minutes while he found a table (clearly he hadn\u2019t checked the reservations before seating the other couple and/or had given our table away).  No apology, pretty inattentive service - having experienced amazing customer service in NYC, this guy definitely wasn\u2019t someone I\u2019d have put in charge of arrivals!  When we were seated, there was barely any room at the tiny tables. The restaurant was very busy so consequently it was incredibly noisy and while I know this contributes to atmosphere, it was impossible to have a quiet conversation (not least because the other tables were so so close!).  Food was good, but honestly I wasn\u2019t blown away - I\u2019ve definitely had better Italian food elsewhere in NYC and in Glasgow and London.  We had the duetto bruschetta to start with burrata, porcini and truffle and guacamole and lobster. It was nice, although the truffle was overpowering and I personally am not particularly convinced by the pairing of guacamole and lobster.  Then we had the Bucantini cacio e pepe with truffle and a special ravioli dish with seafood sauce and mussels.  Cacio e Pepe is my all time favourite Italian dish. I\u2019m afraid I wasn\u2019t blown away by this one. The pasta was a little more than al dente and the truffle sauce overpowered the simple cacio e pepe sauce too much.  The ravioli was filled with spinach and ricotta accompanying a very rich seafood sauce, it was nice but again a little heavy.  We had a very nice bottle of Primitivo, that was probably the highlight.  Generally the service wasn\u2019t great - probably because it was so busy, but still. Twice in the hour we were there birthdays were announced with music so loud it could burst your ear drums - a tradition I don\u2019t mind so much because it\u2019s nice to make a fuss of someone on their bday but the music went on for so long, long after people had lost interest!  I don\u2019t like writing negative reviews because it is so difficult running and maintaining restaurants profitably and so all the positives should be celebrated. But this place is so highly rated I just wanted to provide some balance for travellers particularly because this wasn\u2019t the outstanding quiet dinner I was expecting."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Le_Clara", "user_id": "Clare T", "user_name": "Le_Clara", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Fleet, United", "user_nb_contributions": 63.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 280.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 48.0, "user_nb_photos": 70.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Luxury Traveler;Trendsetter"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "701897", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d8178635-Reviews-Damnak_Lounge_Fine_Dining-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "May 19, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Amazing breakfast when booked Privilege Floor", "review": "We stayed at the Privilege Floor and with that includes an A La Carte Breakfast instead of the Buffet downstairs.

What a pleasant surprise! I had the blackened fish tacos and yummy Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough, New Zealand, and my husband had the tuna poke appetizer and a grilled chicken and mango salad. He kept commenting how unique and delicious the lemony dressing was. The salad was a large entree sized portion, which you don't always find when you order salad for lunch in Manhattan.  The decor is fun and as you'd expect if someone named Tommy Bahama lived there. The bathrooms were gorgeous, which is always a pleasant surprise in New York City restaurants.  Our server, Jared, was fabulous. Friendly, efficient, and very knowledgable about the dishes (my husband has food restrictions).

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "7019138", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

Quiet and charming ambience, helpful and knowledgeable staff and amazing food made this an evening we will long remember. $70 prix fix dinner offers ample choices. The food is beautifully prepared and presented - starting with wonderful bread choices, an amazing mini- ravioli amuse bouche right to the incredible desserts we felt we were in a foodies' paradise. We are sure that anything we might have ordered would have been top notch but I have to mention the chicken liver ravioli, duck breast, diver scallops, apple tarte and chocolate dessert. Wines by the glass were excellent and the waiter guided us in making a choice.

Location  The La Sala restaurant is located within a beautiful lagoon surrounded by tropical plants and birds. It can be found within the Anantara Phuket Villas a short walk from Turtle Village, Anantara vacation club and JW Marriot. The maintained beach is a short walk away.  Staff and service  The service we received was some of the best we have had in all of Asia. Staff are extremely attentive, fully aware of dietary requirements and needs of customers. We are vegan (no meat, fish, dairy) so it can often be quite tricky, but La Sala staff were quick to recommend delicious alternatives.  I have a 5 year old boy that can get restless during large breakfasts. The staff were quick to recognise this and suggested that he tried feeding fish. Also while ordering, the staff suggested certain foods he might like to try. These personal touches puts this restaurant above the competition.  Food  Every dish that we tried was excellent and full of flavour. There are a number of western and Asian dishes to choose from. In my five days, I tried most of them. The food was made and delivered quickly.  Covid  During this challenging time, it is highly important that hotels and restaurants have a impeccable level of cleanliness. La Sala was extremely clean with all staff socially distancing and wearing masks.  Finally  At this stage I would like to personally thank Khun Samorn, Ann Waad Tuk and Goong for their amazing service and attentiveness during our stay. You have all gone above and beyond your duty.  We will never forget the service at La Sala. I will recommend this restaurant to friends and relatives.

Outside dining with blue and white tones, over looking the ocean (if you are there before sunset). Their online reservation system is VERY broken. We had a reservation for New Year\u2019s Eve (we received an email confirmation) but when we showed up, they had no record of it. They informed us that they were not doing the menu that night and sent us on our way - where are you supposed to find another restaurant at 9 pm on New Year\u2019s Eve? We decided to try again on January 2nd. Again made reservations online...and received an email confirmation. Got to the restaurant and they had no record of the reservation...at least this time they accommodated us. As I said before, a lovely setting. Our waiter had some struggles providing us with accurate menu information (actually was inaccurate on his description of several menu items) and overall the service was fair at best. If you are looking at their menu online - DON\u2019T! It is not the same....and the menu at the restaurant was not descriptive - hard to know what you were going to get. We saw nothing served on a salt block. I am wondering if they have changed management or the menu compared to previous reviews - usually Trip Advisor is a good reflection of a restaurant- but not this time - look only at recent pictures and reviews! Most items were very overpriced! We had Tiger Prawn Cocktail - it was only 2 (two!) prawns and cost 750 Bhat! They were good, but really? We ordered two bottles of wine that were listed in the menu for 1700 bhat and we were charged 2000 bhat per bottle! As for main dishes- the ribeye was fair at best, the scallops were 4 scallops - very tender but otherwise very average...the best dish we had was the blue swimmer crab - 4 crabs, very tasty but a lot of work to eat. The Parmesan mashed potatoes were good, enough for two people. The Lobster Mac and Cheese? Not an accurate description at all...it was more of a pasta in a lobster bisque - no cheese to speak of. We ordered asparagus - sorry, they were out. So, I don\u2019t usually tell people to avoid a restaurant - but we had much better meals and experiences in Phuket- eat elsewhere!"}}, "output": {"review_rating": 2.0}}]}}, {"id": "701964", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d1017662-Reviews-The_Park_Room-London_England.html", "review_date": "March 6, 2022", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Exceptional!", "review": "Fantastic experience from start to finish!

If we had known about Manzil La Tortue when we were booking our accommodation, we would have definitely booked to stay there. Highly recommended.

Benihana is a legend in the teppanyaki cuisine and for what it is, it\u2019s fine. This is a place for food theatre where people go with their kids / friends for a fun evening.  Service \u2013 the service is good at this Benihana. The reception was nice and efficient and the waitresses are nice, drinks and non-teppanaki items served quickly and they did a good job with special requests on the table. Chefs were fun, engaged the kids and put on a good show for everyone.  Food \u2013 Ordered the cod with miso and a side of scallops. The fish was good enough, but the miso was added as a sauce (vs glazed on top) which was disappointing. The unique black cod taste was lost on the grill and the luscious oiliness of the fish was lost. My son ordered beef and eat everything as it was served medium so soft to eat in bite size pieces so he liked it. I am not a fan of the food and only attended on the request of my son.  Value \u2013 teppanyaki is always expensive. My young son and I had 2 mains, 1 starter and a glass of wine and it cost us \u00a390. Every time I pay the bill for a teppanyaki dinner, I vow never to come back and year after year the kids beg to come back for the show which obviously made the meal delicious to them.  Benhihana does the teppanyaki show well and kids and groups will enjoy the experience. It seems fully booked all the time so there is certainly an audience for it. But it is not good value for money, and the food is uninteresting and bland (even with their sauce options). If the kids have a great desire to go then we may consider going back, but never for any other reason."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/TMausH", "user_id": "TMausH", "user_name": "TMausH", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "London, United", "user_nb_contributions": 228.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 137.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 171.0, "user_nb_photos": 35.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Luxury Traveler;Family Vacationer"}, "history": [{"id": "7019860", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1223683-d2459474-Reviews-Sea_Fire_Salt_Anantara_Mai_Khao_Phuket_Villas-Mai_Khao_Thalang_District_Phuket.html", "review_date": "August 22, 2014", "review_city": "Phuket, Thailand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Not hugely impressed and very expensive", "review": "This is a very pretty restaurant on the beachfront at the Anantara hotel. The location and set up is very nice, and having a meal beside the beach with the crashing waves in the background is very romantic and soaking with atmosphere and style.  Service: The service was exemplary as expected at an Anantara. Attentive, helpful, and unobtrusive. They were kind enough to help move us inside to the air conditioned space which helped when it became too hot. They explained much of the dishes to us as well which was nice. When we left they got us a buggy to the reception and called our hotel and asked them to send a buggy to collect us. We were very impressed and pleased with this.  Food: The menu is very limited with only a few options for starters, mains and desserts. I was hoping for more seafood dishes and options. Their hallmark dish was seafood cooked on top of salt bricks. Heating the bricks and cooking it on top allows the seafood to absorb some of the flavour of the exotic salts. It felt gimmicky and I could not really taste any great benefit. I ordered the prawn version and it tasted like regular grilled prawns and was nothing special. I hoped to have some of the famous Thai flavours and passion reflected in the food. But I found the meal a bit bland. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the food was fresh and all was very well executed but the mains were really not that interesting. The salt sommelier was there to assist with different types of salt to enhance your meal. I am a fan of interesting salts but again, this felt a bit forced. I could barely tell the difference between the salts and quite frankly, didn\u2019t care. I just wanted to really good, tasty seafood. The starters were very good \u2013 most especially the rocket and pear salad which was quite WOW but a very small portion. The desserts were nicely made but nothing extraordinary. There was also a seafood feast but for the price, did not seem well worth it.  Price: This place was very expensive. I dont normally mind paying for good food but this felt unnecessarily expensive for what it was. I love Ananatra as a hotel and frequently dine at their restaurants even when I am not staying with them but the pricing of the is menu felt much too expensive for the food you were getting. Even if the price were lower, I would not be keen to come back again as I don\u2019t find the food (except the salad) worth the inflated cost. It is a rarity that I do not like an Anantara establishment but the balance of value for money for atmosphere \u2013 made me feel disappointed.  I would not go back again for dinner as nothing interested my taste buds. I would not mind to have a drink or light snack there but as a dinner, I felt I could get better food, variety and price at one of the other dining options on the hotel property."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 2.0}}]}}, {"id": "701987", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d2507902-Reviews-The_Spice_Indian_Restaurant-London_England.html", "review_date": "August 2, 2022", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Amazing!", "review": "We have visited many times over the years.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.  The points above wouldn\u2019t stop me from visiting again but there\u2019s room for improvement."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 3.0}}, {"id": "7020092", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d9861395-Reviews-Fresh_Fruit_Factory-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "April 12, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Not many choices for lunch but the choices they do have are tasty", "review": "The only choices for the mains is cold pasta.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "7020098", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

When you walk-in the restaurant it may originally appear to be a little underwhelming but I can assure you that you are in for a special evening! First you need to make a reservation as there are very few seats. In fact we made our reservation more than 30 days in advance. With Peter and Martin as both our hosts and Chef for the evening we were treated to an array of great starter courses and later on some nice main courses as well - but make no mistake this is true family Italian. We also tried several fine Italian wines all by the glass and all were very good and quite reasonable. Between the four of us we must have enjoyed 10 glasses of wine, 8 different starters, 4 different mains, a dessert, and 4 glasses of grappa all for about $35 US per person.  But not only was the food terrific and all prepared right in front of you - the interaction with the owners Peter and Martin was just as much fun!

I have to admit that I\u2019ve been to a few of these. I enjoy the opportunity to taste lots of different things and the surprise of what might come next. So when I was in Buenos Aires, I decided to try Aramburu.  A lovely ambience in the restaurant, and as expected of a fancy restaurant, the level of the service from the staff was superb. Ever attentive, always friendly. I was lucky to be sat at one of the chef\u2019s table, facing the kitchen, and was able to witness the magnificent way the whole process seem to run so smoothly.  All that counts for nothing though if the food is not right, so what did I think? It didn\u2019t start well. The starter course on the whole was a flop for me. They look amazing, but the taste just did not match. Take the soup & potato crisp that we started with. Both parts were way too salty. The next 2 plates of 3 bite-size food was underwhelming, and I really didn\u2019t understand that carrot tartare. Why? From that first part, the only thing I really enjoyed was the baby goat in donut pastry.  Fortunately, things kicked up a notch after that. In sporting terms, the next 6 courses were absolute home runs. Oyster in coconut milk & granita, mushroom with egg yolk, shrimp & endive salad, fish with Jerusalem artichoke, quail, deer. Ah, heavens. I\u2019m really not a salad person, so it comes as a surprise to myself that the shrimp & endive salad was one of the tastiest thing I\u2019ve ever had. The combination of flavours and textures was just mind-blowing. The mushroom dish had such intense flavour. The quail was cooked to perfection. I could go on, but I\u2019m making myself hungry. Suffice to say they lived up to the best dishes that I\u2019ve had anywhere in the world.  After the amazing highs of the section I consider mains, the desserts were a bit of a come down. Don\u2019t get me wrong they were not bad. The palate cleanser was smart & interesting, and both the pre-dessert and the main dessert were tasty, but they were just not spectacularly amazing, which was the standard that was set by the mains.  Given the quality of the food and service, the cost of the evening was really quite reasonable.  Overall, if there were some changes made to the starter section, this could very well best meal that I have ever had. I was very close to overlooking my dislike of the starters and giving it 5 stars, but I think it\u2019s fairer to give it 4. If I\u2019m back in Buenos Aires, I would go again, and cross my fingers that I can give it a full 5 stars next time."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/ghenix", "user_id": "ghenix", "user_name": "Me L", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "London, United", "user_nb_contributions": 119.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 48.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 83.0, "user_nb_photos": 175.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Urban Explorer"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "702070", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293734-d11962970-Reviews-Barometre_Marrakech-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html", "review_date": "May 6, 2019", "review_city": "Marrakech, Morocco", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Fantastic hidden gem", "review": "I visited here with my daughter on our last night in Marrakech.

There were only four entr\u00e9es to choose from and one was a cheese platter. The other entr\u00e9e choices were sea bass , wyagu beef and sweet breads. My husband wanted none of them however he chose the wyagu beef. The sauce for the beef was excellent and he enjoyed it however at \u20ac135 it should be more than very good . I ordered the Seabass and found it adequate. The risotto with curry that came with the beef also had an excellent sauce. Some of the servers, including James and Amin, were very good. Leopold never brought the citrus vinaigrette I requested and seemed to completely forget it. He also had to be asked to serve us bread. There were many \u201cextras\u201d that were provided at no charge,but being very gourmet,required a receptive palate. I loved the artichoke appetizer bite with curry,but my husband didn\u2019t care for any of them. We ordered a la carte,but with a \u20ac90 bottle of wine ( which was the least expensive Bordeaux on the menu) and coffee, our bill before tip was \u20ac333. We are world travelers and have stayed at some of the best hotels. Overall, I would give the food a B-. My husband gave it a much lower rating than that. If we had ordered the six course fixed menu with wine, the bill would have been well over \u20ac600. You would have had the same four entrees as well.

Dan and Henry do an excellent job of presenting creative dishes with well paired wines. We will definitely be trying some of his recipes.

At Christmas, I\u2019d seen significant improvements overall, providing some further feedback on the mains specifically (see previous review). With an unexpected return visit in March, I looked forward to my dining experience.  The amuse bouche of scrambled eggs black truffle and chives was excellent. The starter - a mesclun truffle salad - lacked finesse (noting I later discovered this had been updated on the main menu but not the vegetarian menu, which still had it as a signature dish in the ~ 40 euro mark when in fact it had been replaced by a basic lettuce leaf salad with a small amount of grated truffle). See photos. As per my previous visit, the mains were still uninspiring and frankly a lazy selection of basic vegetables \u2013 noting the morels were extremely salty. The mille-feuille dessert was very enjoyable.  Service was inattentive \u2013 15 minute waits were frequent for clearing plates, asking for the sommelier to their arrival, etc.  On advising the Ma\u00eetre d' of my initial disappointment with the starter, and on providing feedback on the experience as a whole, he was very professional. And assured me the feedback would be noted.  As Hotel Le Bristol prides itself on being a level above most hotels, and commands a premium for such, I sincerely hope improvements are made.

The meat and the chorizos were cooked to perfection. That is what a parrilla is about. We did not have problems with the service as mentioned in some comments. It was just correct.

By 8.45pm we were wondering what was happening with the table so I asked the waitress and they said that they had given away our table as we weren't all here on time. Outraged I asked why no one had told us. Blank faced ignored the question and told me that we were all late and that's the policy. I then asked to speak to the manager who was just as clueless and rude. Not explaining why he had given away our table without informing us. Arriving early and being told to wait in the bar they knew we were waiting for the table yet still they ignored us. The manager said there's nothing he can do as there are no tables and we should wait. By 9.15pm we were still waiting and by then my party was frustrated, hungry and shocked at the service being received. No apology was given and no one seemed to care. We ended up leaving the restaurant and the whole birthday celebration was ruined. We had all travelled from out of London just to be ignored and treated like rubbish.  I would never return to this place again. Clearly it's popular because of the chefs performances when cooking the food but the service is terrible. No people skills.

We decided to have a stroll around some of Lisbons many bars and eateries and graze on some of the fantastic food. ( well that was the plan ) We both liked the look of Grau Douro from the reviews and found the establishment very easily in Rua Dunques de Braganca. On arrival the small (but cosy) place was very busy and having no booking we were offered a seat at the bar.This offer was accepted and the owner came straight over with the drinks menu , we are not knowledgeable about Portuguese wine so asked for some guidance. He asked what we liked and suggested a couple of wines ( neither were expensive) and promptly poured a taste of each, followed by a full measure. We quaffed the lovely wine ordered some more and asked for the food menu. The owner who was clearly in control of the whole show was exhilarating to watch , moving from table to table , laughing and joking with the customers and even playing the accordion from time to time a delight to observe. The food arrived Covert ( bread with oil ) the Prawns in garlic sauce and a portion of Bacalhau a bras (codfish , slices of potato and egg cooked in the oven) both dishes were absolutely delicious. Unfortunately by siting at the bar the Toucinho do Ceo do Avo ( Grandpa`s Heavenly Tart ) was positioned on the bar top just in front of us , so a portion along with a very nice glass of port had to be consumed to finish the night. Everything about the place is fantastic, the food is amazing , the staff are friendly and great , the atmosphere is homely , all in all a great find , needless to say we only managed the one bar that night best laid plans and all that. Grau Douro thankyou for a Fantastic Evening.

I started out with the Mackerel sashimi which is my favorite and it was terrific. I then enjoyed Guineafowl with stuffed nettles and garlic served for 2. I've not had anything like it. Tender, juicy and full of flavors I was not accustomed to. They feature a excellent wine list and some delicious deserts. Great atmosphere and I must emphasize the stellar service. The staff was friendly, engaging, knowledgeable, and eager to please. One of the finest meals I've had in all my visits to Praha.

The spring rolls were good and the accompanying sauce is not overly sweet as is often the case, but not here.  The t-bone was very nice. A bit of char and smoky flavour. It was ordered medium-rare and came slightly over but it was still heartily enjoyed.  The tenderloin was a much thicker cut and also ordered medium-rare. It came slightly under.  The presentation of the steaks and the condiments is excellent.  The margaritas were very good and generous with the tequila.  Coffees and more banter with the staff finished a very enjoyable night and our best meal in Siem Reap over three days.  The food for the price plus the service makes this place a winner.

Each time I had the venison, which is easy to \"get wrong\" -- but it was perfect in seasoning, sauce, cooking temperature and a duet of thin-sliced asparagus and polenta cakes. The plate presentation is as good as any New York high end restaurant - but expect to spend about 1/4 of what you would in the Big Apple. The best leading indicator is the wine list -- carefully curated and personally selected, and priced for you to enjoy a variety of pairings, not make you feel guilty about venturing into new areas.

It was my daughter's 21st birthday celebrations, and I have always wanted to go to Theo's restaurant as I am a huge fan of his and Saturday Kitchen on BBC1 so always enjoy his appearances on the show. The restaurant knew it was my daughters birthday as I had informed them, but we were not expecting the fuss that was made of us. We were put on one of the chef's tables (Matt Tebutt and his wife had the other which just made my night) and Theo greeted us, wished Lily a happy birthday. He had time for everyone in the restaurant, guests were in and out of the kitchen all evening. The waitress we had was just fabulous and we had an absolutely superb evening, one we will be talking about for years to come.

As simple as that.", "review": "It's a convoluted route to get to Pepe Nero, but what a glorious experience when you arrive. We had a week in Marrakech, and this is far and away the best restaurant - infinitely better than the posh restaurants around the main squares and far, far better than the supposedly typical Moroccan eateries within the expensive hotels. It's Italian cooking, and Moroccan cooking - two menus; you take your choice, or mix and match from both. The chef trained in London and Italy, and brought his expertise here. The food is very good, the wine even better (feel free to ask if you can taste before you choose, and the extremely helpful waiters will oblige) and the setting sublime, with rose petals in the central fountain, handy loos off the huge courtyard, interesting little atmospheric side rooms and up-and-down, higgeldy-piggeldy steps and corridors everywhere. Housed within the Riyad al Moussika in Derb Charkaoui, it took us about 20 minutes to walk to the restaurant, down a series of winding alleyways and streets, following the black signs, from Jamaa el Fna. However, it only took us 5 minutes to get back at the end of the evening, as we were allowed to leave via the kitchens and a secret back route! The food is excellent. I began with salmon tartare, the only criticism being that some of the avocado pieces in the assemblage weren't totally ripe. My bride had a starter of warm aubergine - a bit like Turkish aubergine dishes. My main course was tortellini - home made in a rich, creamy parmesan sauce. My bride opted for risotto with shrimp. All dishes top-notch, and very filling. The service is terrific, with sparky, cheeky waiters who love a bit of banter. This is a restaurant to enjoy and experience. Pre-booking essential as it, understandably, sells out most evenings. We had an excellent bottle of Moroccan wine - a 2016 Medaillon cabernet for around \u00a325. Total price for two, including water and service, was about \u00a380 sterling equivalent. If this restaurant was in the UK or Europe, it would be 'bib gourmand' status in the Michelin ratings."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/PUMBRIDGE", "user_id": "PUMBRIDGE", "user_name": "PUMBRIDGE", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "London, United", "user_nb_contributions": 698.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 138.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 342.0, "user_nb_photos": 362.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Urban Explorer;Like a Local"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "702247", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d3835034-Reviews-Blue_Wagon-Prague_Bohemia.html", "review_date": "December 19, 2021", "review_city": "Prague, Czech Republic", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "A wonderful evening from start to finish", "review": "We went to the Blue Wagon to start the holiday season here in Prague.

We started with the prawns with passion fruit, chili and coriander and were gobsmacked! The taste was perfect - and prawns were served warm. The homemade bread and butter with seasalt was a wonderful addition. For the main I had the veal steak and my partner had the rabbit - which was tender and not dried out! The wine by the glass was good, but served only by the deciliter. And the dessert menu was too limited for us. We would have had a dessert, but they were only two sweet desserts and a cheese plate.

It wasn't very hard to find and I went in to hide from the heating sun. There weren't many people when I was there but soon, the place filled up a bit. The couple were very welcoming the moment I stepped foot into the place and gave me a glass of cool water before I even ordered. I asked for a recommendation and the lady boss recommended and mango and passionfruit ice. I asked if it will be too big a bowl for me so she explained that I could opt for the smaller portion at US$1 lesser so I took that. While waiting for the ice, I was admiring the wall and pillars in the shop, which hundreds, if not thousands, of travelers have left notes on. The place was cosy and clean and definitely good for a breather from the heat. The ice came and I fell in love with it even from the first mouthful. The ice is not just pure ice but has condensed milk in it and it was really fragrant. The passionfruit sauce wasn't sour but has a mixture of sweetness in it as well. Perfect!

Though I have some reservations about the materials and style of the Park Hyatt Milan, I wanted to check out the Paris location. Indeed the \"look and feel\" of the entry and lobby areas is quite similar, as is the building itself, a building with interior courtyard covered by a glass cupola. The contemporary clean look, the shiny pretty marble floors, are marred by what in my opinion is some pretty disquieting 'art-work' and decor (see pictures of the spooky light fixtures and creepy (in my opinion, alright) paintings). I'm thinking, with all the universally loved and beautiful and creative and glee-giving art out there, how could they have made these choices? What message are they trying to convey to us? \"Watch out or the creepy light fixure men will descend upon you and scratch your eyes out?\" I dunno.  To the restaurant; we were seated in the cupola area which happened to be packed at lunchtime. The entry to the kitchen is equipped with a long table upon which all that takes place can be viewed as reflections in surround mirrors on walls and ceiling, angled precisely for that purpose. We were offered a cocktail and when we expressed interest in a coupe of champagne, we were elegantly described the houses, vintage of choices, last but evidently not least was the hyatt labeled something or other famous-house made especially to celebrate the hotel's 10th anniversary. I asked, \"it isn't $3000 a glass is it? \" and was told, well it is more expensive than the other types but it isn't that much...\" We would \"laugh\" about that later when we got the bill and saw that over half the amount was attributable to the \u20ac45ish per glass of champagne orders!  I had the raw scallops, beautifully presented, but taste-free, much to my increasing-with-each-bite dismay. There were the very tasty dried berry dotting the plate adding beautiful color, and the paper-thin sliced radish so thin it was translucent, and some other exotic plant which were the tastiest things on my plate. The St. Jacques were perhaps defrosted? Dunno. I forget what my husband had, and which I tasted too. I guess that sums that up.  Delicious bread products, as always, the hand-finished patty of butter (not to my liking though).  Great service, cool ambiance, but very loud as the cupola created an acoustic bubble.  Happily I did not hear any sound from noisy printers like one hears in the Milan Park Hyatt.  All in all, great atmosphere, great service, stick to the regular vintages of champagne unless you are on an expense account, and don't rely on the menu offerings to satisfy a need for very tasty cuisine.  Oh, and did I mention the artwork? Have a look. Maybe some people will enjoy these pieces, which are probably even famous and were probably very costly too. And beware of those light-fixure men; watch your eyes!"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/melanieag", "user_id": "melanieag", "user_name": "melanieag", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Ateleta, Italy", "user_nb_contributions": 40.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 186.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 44.0, "user_nb_photos": 79.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Urban Explorer;Nature Lover"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "702259", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d1504569-Reviews-Grand_Cru_Restaurant-Prague_Bohemia.html", "review_date": "February 15, 2015", "review_city": "Prague, Czech Republic", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "For me the best restaurant in Prague", "review": "Jan Pun\u010doch\u00e1\u0159 is my favorite chef, Le Terroir was my favorite place because of him and still hast his track.

(thats just one example of the poor communication). We ordered several items that were not in stock. Despite that fact that there were only about 4 other tables occupied (at 7pm on a busy Sunday) it took almost an hour for food to be served. When the food eventually came it WAS very tasty, but several of the meals were cold or only luke warm at best.

I'd have to demand the old pasta back. And then there's the octopus... I had tried their salad before, amazing octopus salad, and today was surprised that there was a different octopus. Brocolli - which I hate - and greek yogurt, with grilled octopus. Hate brocolli? OMG no! It was incredible! The octopus too of course... OK I'm rambling.

I asked for a recommendation and the lady boss recommended and mango and passionfruit ice. I asked if it will be too big a bowl for me so she explained that I could opt for the smaller portion at US$1 lesser so I took that. While waiting for the ice, I was admiring the wall and pillars in the shop, which hundreds, if not thousands, of travelers have left notes on. The place was cosy and clean and definitely good for a breather from the heat. The ice came and I fell in love with it even from the first mouthful. The ice is not just pure ice but has condensed milk in it and it was really fragrant. The passionfruit sauce wasn't sour but has a mixture of sweetness in it as well. Perfect!

It was a venison \"hunter's pie\" served as part of a venison two-ways main course. The other part was the most perfectly cooked piece of venison I have ever had, but the pie was life changing. I had never had venison served in a shredded bbq-esque presentation before, nor had I have had mashed potatoes with white chocolate. Now I wonder how I could have missed out on such a genius combination for so long. I will never see mashed potatoes the same way again.  Like the Park Hyatt hotel itself, where I stayed, there's really nothing to fault about my meal here. If anything, the amuse were just fine (but interesting and creative), and then the meal just kept building strength upon strength. The desserts were astoundingly good. The only negative I can think of is that I had way too much food (and wine), and almost fell asleep. But then the pre-dessert refresher did it's job at waking me up for the actual desserts that pushed our meal past midnight.  Many reviewers suggest another star will be awarded to Pur' in time, and it's not hard to see why. It really felt like a 1-star restaurant cooking above its level, and therefore it was almost a relative bargain, if you can call a E200pp+ meal that.

It\u2019s quite new and I\u2019m unsure if it\u2019s overly mainstream, yet! It is hand-on-heart the best food I\u2019ve ever tasted in my life. Packed with flavour.  We only found it by googling \u201cbest dinner in UBUD\u201d  We tried so, so many places in Ubud, including Twist, Elys Kitchen, and many more \u2014 all amazing, by the way. However, we went to AKAR & our minds were blown. A notch above everywhere we\u2019ve been at home and in Bali.  The atmosphere is unbeatable. The service is surreal, even for bali standards (already a high standard). The food - phenomenal.  The dark chocolate souffl\u00e9 is out of this world, as is the warm brownies.  Ps: no, this is not \u201ccheap & cheerful\u201d, but it\u2019s also not too far at the \u201cfine dining\u201d end of the spectrum either\u2026. portions are good sized. It is truly a must.  Cocktails also unreal.  If you come to UBUD and don\u2019t try this place, you\u2019ve missed out (and Twist)  Finally - no, I\u2019m not on commission ha ha.

Sorry Fred, the picture simply doesn\u2019t convey the explosion of taste in that first mouthful of juicy double stack burger that is the El Clasico, sheer burger bliss. I elected to have the patties cooked medium well, and the result was a juicy burger with two patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and the tomato aioli sauce. The Big Boy, another winner with the crispy bacon topping the patties. Toasted pineapple slices gave the Waikiki a different taste sensation and the Croc Dundee with the fried egg and beetroot was just an amazing meal. Mustn\u2019t forget the onion rings and the ice cold Changs. My wife enjoyed her Blues Brothers (without the bun) and on other nights the chicken wings , chicken on green plate and those tasty chips.  There are still more gourmet creations to be sampled, another trip from OZ necessary, the YOLO remains a challenge to be tackled.

It was my daughter's 21st birthday celebrations, and I have always wanted to go to Theo's restaurant as I am a huge fan of his and Saturday Kitchen on BBC1 so always enjoy his appearances on the show. The restaurant knew it was my daughters birthday as I had informed them, but we were not expecting the fuss that was made of us. We were put on one of the chef's tables (Matt Tebutt and his wife had the other which just made my night) and Theo greeted us, wished Lily a happy birthday. He had time for everyone in the restaurant, guests were in and out of the kitchen all evening. The waitress we had was just fabulous and we had an absolutely superb evening, one we will be talking about for years to come. We had the Sicily taster menu, 5 courses with wines that accompany the courses. every course was sublime. And at \u00a350 a head, thoroughly affordable for the West End of London. Cannot wait to return, already planning my next visit. And I know I keep thanking him, but thank you Theo, and thank you to all the staff. You really have a great team"}}, "output": {"review_rating": 5.0}}]}}, {"id": "702318", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d12874407-Reviews-Kroya_by_Chef_Chanrith-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "February 24, 2015", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Outstanding food ans service", "review": "We stay at the Shinta Mani Club, and we decide to have dinner every day at this restaurant.

Starters were a traditional Cambodian mango sallad with the twist of dried snake. This was followed by a deep fried pork stuffed sticky rice cake served with a fish ceviche dip. Both dishes were traditional yet modern. Precise and fresh flavours.  Main course comprised three dishes: lemon grass spiced fish with a tofu-ginger sauce, a papaya-basil-shrimp soup and curry-peanut fried beef tenderloin. All stretched the flavours in their own way. Together they formed a united, well composed dish.  It all finished with a raspberry sorbet, a sticky rice and sesame seed roll and coconut sago soup. Balanced and tasty.  Only drawback is the lack of a wine pairing meny. So we grabbed all their eight wine-by-the-glass and enjoyed our wine pairing ourselves.

I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hangontravelingwoman", "user_id": "hangontravelingwoman", "user_name": "hangontravelingwoman", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "25-34", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Minato, Japan", "user_nb_contributions": 194.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 17.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 82.0, "user_nb_photos": 343.0, "user_tags": "Vegetarian;Eco-tourist;Thrifty Traveler"}, "history": [{"id": "7023500", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d14007799-Reviews-WILD_Creative_Bar_Eatery-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "January 4, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Fab cocktails in a nice garden setting", "review": "The cocktails at Wild are really fab.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.  The points above wouldn\u2019t stop me from visiting again but there\u2019s room for improvement."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 3.0}}, {"id": "7023502", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d9861395-Reviews-Fresh_Fruit_Factory-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "April 12, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Not many choices for lunch but the choices they do have are tasty", "review": "The only choices for the mains is cold pasta.

It was such a great find by my boyfriend, who wanted to take me somewhere special for my birthday on January 4th and had booked it from trawling through TripAdvisor, not that he had to trawl far. This little restaurant is so quaint and delightful, it has so much charm, from the place itself to the waitresses and chef who all severed us at one point. A little music (or a tad louder) would have only added to the lovely ambiance. To start we had a gin cocktail as an aperitif whilst we perused over the wine menu. We were then given cured meat, bread and home made butter - this butter was to die for. We selected a bottle of wine (all great prices compared to other restaurants) and soon after our dishes began arriving one by one. I can't actually remember what was in every single one but I do know they were all delicious! The octopus was so tender, the fish lovely and light, the beef was so flavoursome, the little onion thing was amazingly tasty (how did you make an onion taste like that?), the dessert was nice but I would have preferred something a little lighter. I did get a candle in my dessert which was really sweet, my boyfriend couldn't remember mentioning that is was my birthday. We thoroughly enjoyed every last bite. The waitress was so lovely and friendly, we also figured out it was the chef who served us also which we loved. You could see their passion for food when they served us each dish and told us all the components.  I love tasting menus, they are my favourite, especially surprise ones! You are always watching and listening to see what the person opposite you is getting so you know what to expect. This is also amazingly great value for money, at only 49 euros each. Leave about 2-2.5 hours to enjoy the experience. An absolute dream, thank you so much Aspic for the best birthday! We went on to the Moulin Rouge afterwards, which is only 5 minutes away in a taxi."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Chellmie", "user_id": "Chellmie", "user_name": "Chellmie", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "25-34", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Aberdeen, United", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 32.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 40.0, "user_nb_photos": 169.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Shopping Fanatic"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "702372", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293920-d10103852-Reviews-Breeze_Bar_Anantara_Layan_Phuket_Resort-Phuket.html", "review_date": "March 26, 2022", "review_city": "Phuket, Thailand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Sunday brunch- almost there", "review": "Decided revisit the Sunday Brunch.

Lamb and beef both medium and dry. Lamb chops not top quality. Too much fat 4) salads were very good as was Thai food. Grapes cheap end with seeds but Chees selection ok.

Was thoroughly impressed from the time I stepped inside. (Don't let the appearance of the exterior cause you any concern.) The place is small but well-managed. Several tables were full (7:00pm) and our reserved table was ready and waiting. The owner/manager greeted us and promptly seated us. From that point on, service was excellent. The menu (authentic Italian) was full of fantastic choices and made it difficult to pick an entr\u00e9e. On the server's suggestion, I tried the cauliflower soup appetizer. It was exceptional. My main course, ravioli with lobster meat was a good choice, too.  Overall, the group enjoyed the meal with numerous complements on the food.

He helped us navigate the wine list which was really a book the size of a novel. He narrowed it down to three for us and then we picked. It was great and went well with our menu.  Also, the menu came out personalized wishing us a happy anniversary and birthday! A small touch that goes a long way. At the end they gave them to us in a folder to take home.  We did the tasting menu. Which is quite deceptive. Each course is not only beautiful but sooooo good. The only course that I didn't absoultey love was the one with the poached egg, kim chee and pork belly. Each course was better than the next. What is deceptive is although the portions seem small you will be incredibly full long before you are done. Make sure to pace yourself. Because the steak course is so good that I was actually sad when I couldn't finish it! It was so tender you could cut it with a plastic fork!  The dessert course is actually three. All three were wonderful and nothing alike so worth having at least some of each.  One tip: We normally eat late. This was a long meal (over three hours). I would reccomend coming a little on the earlier side (5:30/6) since you will still be there quite a while for the tasting menu.

The swing seating is also quite an eye opener - Elegant, playful, brings a real element of 'occasion' to dining there.  Things started well, but a lack of detail started to emerge once the dining service got under way. The bottle of white wine we ordered was cool not cold upon opening and wasn't at it's proper temperature from the cooler until the last glass; My dining companion ordered the $31 tasting menu whilst I went a la carte.  Their serving procedure was to serve half of the tasting menu dishes in one go, to link with my starter course, and then serve the other half of the tasting menu all in one go again when my main course was served. Never experienced this in our collective lives, and we've seen how it's done in Thai restaurants in Bkk with different orders so it isn't a particular regional practice to cram up tasting menu courses to match an a la carte one. My companion ended up sending some dishes back to hold, to allow her to finish one course without letting the other dishes get cold and of course to concentrate on one set of flavours at a time. Most disappointed.  To be fair, the food was decent, I enjoyed my courses - had a lovely tofu tempura for starters (it was a main from their vegetarian menu) and soft shell crab for mains. All really well made and seasoned. Oh, except the rice - Cold rice. In SE Asia, that's almost heresy.  Service was too variable for comfort - As well as the above, our servers would either swarm around, or disappear - getting the bill at the end required catching the eye of one waiter who Pointed to another one who nodded, who came by a few minutes later to ask what we wanted.  It was too strange, at such variance to our normal experience in SR (and even at the very same restaurant where I'd eaten lunch last year). What made it go from a \"let's chalk this up to bad chance\" to \"this really isn't acceptable\" was that dinner including modest wine, and service ended up at $110 - By far the most we'd paid for food in SR, including at the fabulous Cuisine Wat Damnak."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gorpalm", "user_id": "gorpalm", "user_name": "gorpalm", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "London, United", "user_nb_contributions": 43.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 134.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 114.0, "user_nb_photos": 150.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;History Buff;Shopping Fanatic"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "702399", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d13958609-Reviews-Mivan_Restaurant_Cafe-Istanbul.html", "review_date": "December 10, 2022", "review_city": "Istanbul, Turkey", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "A taste of Istanbul", "review": "We had two dinner here during our stay in December, one was not enough.

For dessert we shared the cheeses and fig board which again was splendid. Followed by tea and coffees.  All this came to under \u00a345 for the two of us.

The \"closed door\" restaurant was in an unmarked house in Palermo, very charming. We selected the tasting menu ($350 pesos per person) and did 5 wine pairings. At the end we ended up receiving a total of 7 wines including a sparkling wine upon arrival and an extra white from Santiago. The pours were huge and I would highly reconmend doing the pairing (an extra $170 pesos) Dinner was wonderful but be warned we were there for 4.5 hours! You almost needed that much time to drink as much wine as we did! We also got totally wrapped up in a game of \"guess the essence from the sommelier kit\" with Santiago.

In veg, i prefer their aloo gobi adraki, very nice amd savory.  And highly recommended are their yellow dal tadka or the dal makhano. Both are very good.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "7024298", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

My drink was horrible. Mushroom soup was edible. Fried squid had little squid in it. Mostly breading. Very limited menu for #1 place overall. We tried a lot better food here.

The restaurant itself is cozy and the seating around the pool was very pretty. We were impressed with the service at first and enjoyed the musical entertainment. The price of the fixed menu shocked us though - 530Dh per person! This was more than double we had paid for any meal yet in Morocco!! We hadn't ate out much though, so we figured it must be worth it. It started off strong with at least 14 Moroccan salads & little appetizers brought to our table which were tasty and different. We ordered the pigeon pastry for our 2nd course, and expected a savoury pastry. It was coated in icing sugar & cinnamon which was unexpected. For our main, we had the lemon chicken and lamb tagines. Again, neither was extraordinary. My lamb was tough and tasteless. We'd had much better of both dishes for a fraction of the price at our riads. In total with wine, our bill was 695Dh each. We were allowed to pay by credit card, but the waiter miscalculated and undercharged our cards without us realizing. I was talking to the head waiter before we left, when the hostess came over and demanded the extra 100Dh. The head waiter took off and neither apologized for what was their mistake. We had also left a generous 150Dh tip for the server. Needless to say, we left with a very bad taste in our mouths. Save your money & don't go. Better food with equally good atmosphere can be had elsewhere I'm sure."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/savvyfarmgirl", "user_id": "savvyfarmgirl", "user_name": "SavvyFarmgirl", "user_ta_level": 4.0, "user_age_range": "25-34", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Ottawa, Canada", "user_nb_contributions": 42.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 53.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 24.0, "user_nb_photos": 17.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Like a Local;History Buff;Nature Lover"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "702459", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g469404-d23741423-Reviews-Casa_Blanca_Bali-Seminyak_Kuta_District_Bali.html", "review_date": "February 19, 2023", "review_city": "Bali, Indonesia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Wonderful Food", "review": "Excellent.

It was so nice to see F&B manager Mr Sheldon talking to the guest making sure everything is good, we had a specific request for our main course and it was accommodated. Their prawn curry was just awesome and my daughter fell in love with their chicken Korage and salt pepper calamari. Every meal we were served was of the exceptional standard even at the room service.

But anyway I loved my \"Benihana Delight\" set menu. Everything about my experience was great.  Price: It is fairly expensive, your looking at least \u00a330/person and you should really only go if you know you can afford to unleash the cash.

Whilst my friend had the bottomless Prosecco, I took the Apero Spritz which is divine. The only thing is that you needed to keep asking for a top-up.  We were served by the most friendly, jovial and polite waiter George, who looked after us very well. There was no request too much for George and he always served us with a beautiful smile.

We don't know what the \"house\" is like except through reviews, but the \"holiday\" version is in a first floor restaurant-like commercial space that did not convey \"house.\" It was modern, clean and well lit for sure, but it holds 25 people so that's quite a crowd. On our particular night, half of the crowd was a group that already knew each other so they sat together on one half of the long communal table. They didn't really mingle as, well, they didn't have to. So there was less over-all mingling than we were hoping for. That said, the non-group people around us were delightful, engaged and pleasantly interactive (folks were from all over the world). The food itself, however, was AMAZING, the best or near best meal of our 12 day trip to Argentina. Luis is a bit soft spoken but he gives a nice introduction about the elements of a \"proper asado\" before he fires up the grills and then another member of his team, a highly fluent (in english) young man who is well versed not only in food but politics and culture, acts as host and service captain. Every course is outstanding. The wine pairings well chosen, and the pours generous. Luis circulates a bit as things progress, which is nice. By 11pm when the dinner ended, the lack of intimacy had softed a bit due to the otherwise happy experience. If you are travelling during the winter holidays, check the website or inqure to see if they are doing this larger group thing again. Don't for an instant hesitate based on food/wine/service alone."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Triptippers", "user_id": "Triptippers", "user_name": "Triptippers", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Portland, Oregon", "user_nb_contributions": 81.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 39.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 76.0, "user_nb_photos": 585.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Urban Explorer"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "702471", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d12874338-Reviews-Los_Tacos_No_1-New_York_City_New_York.html", "review_date": "October 20, 2019", "review_city": "New York City, United States", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "A great taco", "review": "We saw the long line on Saturday night and made a point to go back and try their tacos on Sunday.
