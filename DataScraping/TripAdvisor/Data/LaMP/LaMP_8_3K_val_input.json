We had only experienced them for afternoon tea before, so perusing their \"all day dining\" menu was a little different.  They have a good selection of salads and sandwiches, which can be augmented with a good selection of wines and champagnes.  Food is a subset of that on offer from the JW Steakhouse (also in the hotel), but served in the opulent style of the Park Room.  If you're looking for something slightly less than afternoon tea, this is an option.

Background: although our previous visit was marred by a menu/billing mix up the food was clearly very good so I wanted to return to experience it to the full and with that in mind I contacted the restaurant to give them my direct feedback. Pawel acknowledged my complaint and was genuinely apologetic and confirmed that he would make amends on our next visit. As it happens I'm not in London that frequently but circumstances necessitated that I was there a few weeks later and therefore made a much anticipated booking.  In a nutshell, it was a top notch experience -Katie our waitress looked after us like we were VIP guests and it was nice to meet Pawel who gave us a warm welcome and also saw us to our table and last but not least Vanessa the Manageress who came over to say \"hello\". Vanessa was very personable and it was really enjoyable to chat with her.  The whole meal was excellent, my favourite is the slow cooked beef ragu in Chianti -a must try dish!

I was checking out various venues and as it was going to be an early evening meeting I spotted that there was an excellent set menu offering at Theos so I immediately made an online booking to secure a table as it was for a Saturday -success, however, heads up, there's a booking system glitch!  On the evening there was confusion with the staff regarding the menu, initially we were given a la carte menus despite the booking stating it was for the set menu.  In the end is was sorted, to a degree, as we were presented with a set menu option, but, not the one I had booked which included half a bottle of wine per person, apparently that one was not recognised and ours only included a glass of prosecco each! I decided not to make a fuss but clearly I was not happy especially for this mix up to happen in such a reputable hotel/restaurant*  Upon returning home I contacted the restaurant and Pawel was very apologetic and acknowledged that there was a glitch on the booking system and that he would make amends for our next visit......  Anyway, back to to the food -it was all very good and the staff were attentive but needless to say the experience was tempered due to the menu saga along with having to pay an extra \u00a340 (unnecessarily) for wine so I shall reserve final judgement and do a more detailed report when we have our return visit.  *I first frequented the London Intercon about 40 years ago."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}]}}, {"id": "7111", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g10804710-d6514028-Reviews-Ciao_Pizza_Grill-Karon_Beach_Karon_Phuket.html", "review_date": "February 14, 2023", "review_city": "Phuket, Thailand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Great Italian/Thai pizza place & superb coffee", "review": "We visit Ciao nearly daily while staying in Hilton.

It was a venison \"hunter's pie\" served as part of a venison two-ways main course. The other part was the most perfectly cooked piece of venison I have ever had, but the pie was life changing. I had never had venison served in a shredded bbq-esque presentation before, nor had I have had mashed potatoes with white chocolate. Now I wonder how I could have missed out on such a genius combination for so long. I will never see mashed potatoes the same way again.  Like the Park Hyatt hotel itself, where I stayed, there's really nothing to fault about my meal here. If anything, the amuse were just fine (but interesting and creative), and then the meal just kept building strength upon strength. The desserts were astoundingly good. The only negative I can think of is that I had way too much food (and wine), and almost fell asleep. But then the pre-dessert refresher did it's job at waking me up for the actual desserts that pushed our meal past midnight.  Many reviewers suggest another star will be awarded to Pur' in time, and it's not hard to see why. It really felt like a 1-star restaurant cooking above its level, and therefore it was almost a relative bargain, if you can call a E200pp+ meal that. And if you're staying at the Park Hyatt already, it is also crazy convenient to stumble back into bed!"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngaS422", "user_id": "Jamie S", "user_name": "Jamie S", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Utrecht, The", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 40.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 37.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "7120", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255122-d8457470-Reviews-Tanoshi_Teppan_and_Sake_Bar-Queenstown_Otago_Region_South_Island.html", "review_date": "April 1, 2018", "review_city": "Queenstown, New Zealand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Small but Nice", "review": "Very popular and very tiny so it pays to book in advance.

We would recommend the spring rolls platter which had two fresh rolls, two crispy seafood rolls and two crispy Hanoi pork rolls. This was followed by a beautifully presented steaming bowl of pho. The pho at the restaurant was a delicately flavoured broth with rice noodles and tender beef. It was different to the rustic flavours you\u2019d get from street food vendors and equally as wonderful. Every pho recipe has some hidden secrets and this was evident in the subtlety different flavours.

Try the classic \"provoleta\" as a starter. It is an Argentine staple, as is the chicken milanesa as a main course. For those who like something sweet and new, try their mashed sweet potatoes. They are not the same root vegetable as eaten in the U.S. It's sweeter and more fragrant. The dulce de leche pancakes for dessert are a great way to end a fabulous meal.

However, the food is nothing like the understated exterior. They offer either a 5 course tasting menu or a la Carter, and they seem to specialise in various types of caviar. The tasting menu was a real wow, specialising in classic French dishes with a a twist. Foie Gras with mussels, smoked potato with caviar, fresh pollock with cream sauce and fantastic duck with girolles and pumpkin. Dessert of pears with ginger was one of the best I\u2019ve ever tasted.

The first impression from the decor is clean and sort of lacking personality or local character: nothing fancy, for all you know, you could be in the lounge of a Hilton anyweher in the world. That's after the first nice course of our tasting menu was served that things quickly turned bad: from the aged \"tartare\" that tasted like old, dry chewing gum and looked more like rabbit poop to the tasteless spike trout or rubbery duck, even an applestrudel that was barely baked, no sugar, no crunch, no flavor...All of that was not at par with a Michelin star-even one-standard, service was ok albeit slow and sometimes inattentive although Libor tried his best...A $75 prix fixe in Prague would and should take you to an incredible level. anywhere else...but this one was one of the worst we experienced in the Czarch capital...even a little lunch at a street Chinese restaraurant the next day was flavorful, fresh and tasty for a mere $10 per person !!! I am not sure why this restaurant that seemes to be operated by Indian owners got to receive the Star or glowing social media reviews here...but I do know, as a French born -now American citizen living in the USA and having dined at more than 50 of the best Michelin star restaurants in the world- that this was one of the most disappointing, deplorable if not outrageous dining experience I ever had in the past 40 years..."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngaS422", "user_id": "Jamie S", "user_name": "Jamie S", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Utrecht, The", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 40.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 37.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "7164", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d12874407-Reviews-Kroya_by_Chef_Chanrith-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "February 22, 2016", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Expensive, but worth it", "review": "Try to get a swing table (book), Service was impeccable and food an interesting fusion.

We also had never experienced a \"Closed-Door dining experience\" where the address of the restaurant is provided to you with your reservation confirmation and you arrive at the address, which is an unmarked door- you ring the bell- give your name- and you are granted entrance into a very special dinner! Luis explained everything we were going to eat... He told us about the 5 wines that would be paired with the 5 courses- he then showed us the FABULOUS pieces of Argentine beef-did I mention that we each got 32 ounces of this mouth watering steak? We had 12 people at our dinner. We were the only people who didn't speak Spanish-it didn't matter one bit! Luis told the two of us everything in English and the people we shared our meal with made us feel welcomed-we all laughed and talked for almost 4 hours! The food was incredible and the company was better!

For dessert we shared the cheeses and fig board which again was splendid. Followed by tea and coffees.  All this came to under \u00a345 for the two of us.

The staff coped really well with the level of demands placed upon them and if you understand that some of them were relatively inexperienced because of the basis on which the business operates then this was even more impressive. The lady manager for the night had only to keep a watching brief and scarcely intervene at all.  The food remains excellent - the fried beef with red ants is a must try. Coupled with great value for money and free pick up and drop off service it make it a first class choice.

We had 3 courses including drinks and paid around 60 Euro which for the quality of the food and service was more than reasonable in my opinion.  The staff were very good and if i was to give them any developmental feedback it would be to take a little more time with the diners as I did feel a little rushed on the second night.

Decent food, nothing really outstanding! Mediocre Wines.", "review": "We had an OK night at casa SaltShaker, but in the end it was a disappointmet, because we  expected MUCH more.  First of all, the food was ok - there's nothing to complain about. However, it wasn't anyting really special. This is definitely NOT world class, in a city famous for its abundance of world class restaurants. Of course, this insight was a disappointment!  The best way to describe what I mean is:  If I was invited to a hobby cook's house and he cooked such a meal, it would be great. If however somebody pretending to be a knowledgable chef invited me to his and cooked this menu for me, I would clearly think that he was not trying nearly as hard as he could, but was saving efforts...  The Casa Saltshaker guys are definitely to be attributed to the hobby cook area...the problem is that TA rates them in the other category (and they think that they belong there...)  The HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT was however was the complete abscence of any personal interaction on behalf of the \"hosts\". When you \"invite\" somebody into your home and you do not wish to exchange even a word with your \"guests\", this is really a bummer. I had the feeling that they were desperate to put us through the process as quickly as possible, collect our money and send us home.  I certainly didn't feel welcome there.  Exemplatory for the attitude towards their guest was this episode:  Coming in I was thirsty and aksed for a glass of water. They rejected it by saying that they would start serving dinner in 10min. REALLY!? Is THAT hospitality?! No one had ever before denied me a glass of water :-)  Making up for the desaster that our hosts were was a quite nice mix of guests with whom we've had a fun evening anyway, despite the hosts (unfortunately not because of them :-)  Last but not least, the wine \"pairing\" we had with the meal was mediocre. We have had wine pairings in good places in Buenos Aires, so we know what can be expected in this price range. The guys either don't have a clue about wine or they simply don't care (I suppose it's the latter, because it fits the overall picture)."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngaS422", "user_id": "Jamie S", "user_name": "Jamie S", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Utrecht, The", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 40.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 37.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "71104", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d18856876-Reviews-Kinara_by_Vikas_Khanna-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html", "review_date": "June 21, 2022", "review_city": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Good", "review": "Good ambiance , nice staff .

Just to mention, that when we left the restaurant, those same youngsters approached us and insisted that the route we were taking was closed off (despite people coming from that direction) and they would show us an alternative route.

I was checking out various venues and as it was going to be an early evening meeting I spotted that there was an excellent set menu offering at Theos so I immediately made an online booking to secure a table as it was for a Saturday -success, however, heads up, there's a booking system glitch!  On the evening there was confusion with the staff regarding the menu, initially we were given a la carte menus despite the booking stating it was for the set menu.  In the end is was sorted, to a degree, as we were presented with a set menu option, but, not the one I had booked which included half a bottle of wine per person, apparently that one was not recognised and ours only included a glass of prosecco each! I decided not to make a fuss but clearly I was not happy especially for this mix up to happen in such a reputable hotel/restaurant*  Upon returning home I contacted the restaurant and Pawel was very apologetic and acknowledged that there was a glitch on the booking system and that he would make amends for our next visit......  Anyway, back to to the food -it was all very good and the staff were attentive but needless to say the experience was tempered due to the menu saga along with having to pay an extra \u00a340 (unnecessarily) for wine so I shall reserve final judgement and do a more detailed report when we have our return visit.  *I first frequented the London Intercon about 40 years ago."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngaS422", "user_id": "Jamie S", "user_name": "Jamie S", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Utrecht, The", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 40.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 37.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": [{"id": "711120", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d803526-Reviews-Theo_Randall_at_the_InterContinental-London_England.html", "review_date": "March 5, 2020", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Return visit", "review": "This review is for my second return visit in January but TripAdvisor does not allow subsequent reviews until at least a month has passed which is a shame as I wanted this to go live immediatlely after our visit.  Background: although our previous visit was marred by a menu/billing mix up the food was clearly very good so I wanted to return to experience it to the full and with that in mind I contacted the restaurant to give them my direct feedback. Pawel acknowledged my complaint and was genuinely apologetic and confirmed that he would make amends on our next visit. As it happens I'm not in London that frequently but circumstances necessitated that I was there a few weeks later and therefore made a much anticipated booking.  In a nutshell, it was a top notch experience -Katie our waitress looked after us like we were VIP guests and it was nice to meet Pawel who gave us a warm welcome and also saw us to our table and last but not least Vanessa the Manageress who came over to say \"hello\". Vanessa was very personable and it was really enjoyable to chat with her.  The whole meal was excellent, my favourite is the slow cooked beef ragu in Chianti -a must try dish!

I personally didn't love the space which was quite dark and cramped so I feel this would be more of a winter dining destination (as it is cosy) than a summer one. We would have liked to check out the bar too but did not manage to do that on this occasion. I think, when we dined here previously (many years ago) that we had our meal on the upper level where the bar now is. I was keen to try some cocktails and was told that not all cocktails made in the bar were available in the restaurant and I wasn't sure why but that's ok. I did have 2 very nice cocktails whilst there (pink diamond and a dessert cocktail as I had no room for dessert after the amazing entree and main). Both myself and my husband had the Paua entree which was sublime and we then had mains as follows: Hubby had the beef which was divine and I had the duck which was exquisite. I can't recall the exact side dishes we had but we had 2 and they complemented our mains beautifully. Wine: the wine list was good but not amazing and somewhere as 'exclusive' as The Bunker should have a better selection IMHO."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngaS422", "user_id": "Jamie S", "user_name": "Jamie S", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Utrecht, The", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 40.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 37.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": [{"id": "711240", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255122-d726702-Reviews-Public_Kitchen_Bar-Queenstown_Otago_Region_South_Island.html", "review_date": "March 11, 2021", "review_city": "Queenstown, New Zealand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Still rocking...", "review": "I have recently been in Queenstown with my husband and another couple after walking the Routeburn Track.

Tables are situated around a pool and a central marble courtyard with a mosaic clad fountain. A large speaker provides some cool background beats. The restaurant offers two menus \u2013 Moroccan and Italian \u2013 with the ability to mix and match both. The latter offered a welcome break from the traditional tagines. The king prawns with diced tomatoes and cocktail sauce and the eggplant mozzarella for starters were both beautifully seasoned and bursting with flavour and the home made fettucine and tortellini parmesan cream for main brought back fond memories of some of the best Italian pasta houses. There is an extensive wine list although the Moroccan wine is slightly on the expensive side. The only downside was the service which can best be described as unfriendly and unengaging and we felt a little rushed with courses arriving quickly when we had indicated we would like a break or, in the case of the bill, unprompted. It was slightly odd to be taken to a back room to pay the bill by credit card but I had nothing to fear in that all of the staff were extremely courteous and polite. This was our stand out favourite restaurant during our nine night stay in Marrakesh and we cannot wait to return.  Tip: Ignore the young men waiting to greet you when you leave the restaurant who will seek to persuade you to follow them on a different route back to the main square on the basis that the conventional route is closed at night. This is a standard ruse at this (and many other) locations and an attempt to fleece you of your hard earned dirhams\u2026\u2026"}}, "output": {"review_rating": 5.0}}]}}, {"id": "71130", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255122-d725999-Reviews-The_Bunker_Restaurant-Queenstown_Otago_Region_South_Island.html", "review_date": "February 27, 2022", "review_city": "Queenstown, New Zealand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Excellent 8 courses", "review": "We went for the full 8 courses, we arrived on time and were offered either to sit at the bar or to head to the table and start.

Each dish was flawless, although the Mackerel dish was a little too fishy for our taste. (Our mistake for never having had Mackerel before.) The Octopus was delicious; tender and perfect. The Bossam (pork belly rice) was beautifully porky without being greasy. The Sea Bream was delicate and flavorful. I would recommend the Galbi (pork ribs), but you can also have them on W 32nd probably just as good but not on such a pretty plate. The desserts were works of art that were as tasty as they were beautiful. The Jang Dok were little kimchi pots made of ganache which was a nice way for the chef to tell his story. Likewise for the Harubang, by far the prettiest plate. I wish there was a little bit more light so we could have enjoyed the beauty of these plates. Wine list is excellent. The service was spot-on and polished, although a little reserved.

The tasting menu and wine pairings were fantastic. Dinner was served by a lovely waitress and all of our pairings were put together by Santiago, one of the owners and a sommelier. The \"closed door\" restaurant was in an unmarked house in Palermo, very charming. We selected the tasting menu ($350 pesos per person) and did 5 wine pairings. At the end we ended up receiving a total of 7 wines including a sparkling wine upon arrival and an extra white from Santiago. The pours were huge and I would highly reconmend doing the pairing (an extra $170 pesos) Dinner was wonderful but be warned we were there for 4.5 hours! You almost needed that much time to drink as much wine as we did! We also got totally wrapped up in a game of \"guess the essence from the sommelier kit\" with Santiago. Even still I wouldn't plan on leaving in much under 4 hours. We were there with friends so it was a great time and the food was fantastic.

The vegetables are grown on the family's own land outside of Marrakech and are delicious. The restaurant is not that easy to find as its down a tiny back street but it it signposted from the square. The courtyard is beautifully elegant with a lovely water feature. Food and service were outstanding and they serve alcohol even in Ramadam. The restaurant is run by the same efficient,friendly guy who is the senior manager of the Riyad. We were staying at Al Moussika so saved this restaurant for our last night and we weren't disappointed. Some reviews said it was priced but we didn't think it was bearing in mind the far superior quality of food and drink on offer.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.  The points above wouldn\u2019t stop me from visiting again but there\u2019s room for improvement."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 3.0}}, {"id": "711532", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d9861395-Reviews-Fresh_Fruit_Factory-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "April 12, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Not many choices for lunch but the choices they do have are tasty", "review": "The only choices for the mains is cold pasta.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "711538", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

I suppose we were just thinking that law of averages would mean at least one poor meal? How wrong we were as we enjoyed probably the best evening of our family break. From the moment we exited the taxi outside the staff were out to greet us, very friendly and made us all feel welcome. You can tell that they all care about their business as they couldn\u2019t do enough for us and even offered us complimentary drinks at the end of the meal. There were all the traditional offerings and some nice specialities too. We had Jalfrezi , chicken saag, and a king prawn korma and I liked the option to have your chicken grilled / tandoori as a opposed to plain. Of course we had poppodums and chutney to start, who doesn\u2019t? All washed down with ice cold Cobra beer. I think everyone was slightly jealous of my wife\u2019s Chicken Saag, not only was it delicious but it came in the hit sizzling pot, which I always feels adds to the experience and I\u2019d encourage them to serve the jalfrezi this way! I\u2019m not sure if this is practical but it certainly makes the table go \u201cooooh\u201d as the sizzling dish approaches. I also liked the fact that when I asked fir my naan bread well done it came nice and crispy just as ordered. Seating was covid friendly and waiters wore face masks so no issues with hygiene/ CV19 To finish off our fabulous evening the waiter allowed my son in law to take away his beautiful cobra glass that he\u2019d been eyeing all evening, which I felt was a lovely touch and made Toms night!

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}]}}, {"id": "71181", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d2345886-Reviews-Jungsik-New_York_City_New_York.html", "review_date": "November 11, 2018", "review_city": "New York City, United States", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Nice surprise!", "review": "We decided to try something different on our last trip to New York and opted for Jungsik.

At Christmas, I\u2019d seen significant improvements overall, providing some further feedback on the mains specifically (see previous review). With an unexpected return visit in March, I looked forward to my dining experience.  The amuse bouche of scrambled eggs black truffle and chives was excellent. The starter - a mesclun truffle salad - lacked finesse (noting I later discovered this had been updated on the main menu but not the vegetarian menu, which still had it as a signature dish in the ~ 40 euro mark when in fact it had been replaced by a basic lettuce leaf salad with a small amount of grated truffle). See photos. As per my previous visit, the mains were still uninspiring and frankly a lazy selection of basic vegetables \u2013 noting the morels were extremely salty. The mille-feuille dessert was very enjoyable.  Service was inattentive \u2013 15 minute waits were frequent for clearing plates, asking for the sommelier to their arrival, etc.  On advising the Ma\u00eetre d' of my initial disappointment with the starter, and on providing feedback on the experience as a whole, he was very professional. And assured me the feedback would be noted.  As Hotel Le Bristol prides itself on being a level above most hotels, and commands a premium for such, I sincerely hope improvements are made.

It is safe to say that the restaurant didn\u2019t disappoint. We were all blown away by the experience. We were greeted by the manager (I believe) and sat down at a nice table. The interior of the restaurant has been redone, and we liked it. Particularly we liked the acoustics of the room. Noise doesn\u2019t travel from table to table, and we could have a relaxed conversation without raising our voices or listening in on whatever was being discussed by the table next to ours. We had a bowl of bread with 3 different kinds of fresh and slightly warm bread. It was accompanied by a herb spread which had nice, subtle flavours and a perfect temperature. I wanted more bread! But thank God they didn\u2019t give me any (I didn't ask for it), because we were all completely full, when we left the restaurant a couple of hours later. The amuse bouche was delicate foam of smoked potatoes. There were some crunchy bits on top and a bit of sour notes from tiny pieces of pickled vegetables as well. These 2 elements gave some texture, and it was a brilliant little dish. The starter was smoked char with almond milk \u201ccaviar\u201d, beluga lentils, horseradish, and marjoram. The trout had a firm, yet tender texture and had received just the right amount of smoke. The subtle horseradish sauce with marjoram complimented both fish and lentils very well and made everything come together. The lentils were perfectly cooked \u2013 I am not sure if \u201cal dente\u201d is a way to describe lentils, but I\u2019ll risk it. The almond milk caviar was mainly on the plate for texture, I believe \u2013 it didn\u2019t pack a lot of flavour. I like that the \u201ceggs\u201d had different sizes. That worked well visually and also when it came to the texture. The size of the portion was generous \u2013 we all agreed that it wouldn\u2019t have been strange at all, if they had served one piece of trout instead of the two nice portions on our plates. The main dish was veal rib eye, beans, dried beef, beets, cashews, and demi glace. We were given a choice how we would like our meat prepared, and we all chose medium. Mine was closer to medium rare, and that was perfectly fine with me. The first impression of the dish came from tasting the demi glace, which was one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. Only the master of sauces, Steven Trumpfheller, has served me a better one. So rich and full of flavour and reduced to the point where it would make my lips stick together. The steak was tender and well seasoned, and it hade more and deeper flavour than I would have expected from veal \u2013 more like a young bull. There were 3 different types of beans on the side, all cooked to perfection. The beets added an earthy and sweet/sour dimension, and the small bites of smoked and dried beef held it together, although my first bite was very tough (the rest weren\u2019t). Just as it was the case with the starter, everything on the plate created a perfect combination, and the dish was quite filling. I regretted not having saved a slice of bread to wipe my plate clean with. Not to embarrass my two friends at the table I decided not to lick the sauce off my plate, but the thought crossed my mind. The dessert was macaroon in two ways, cherry, chocolate, tangerine, and basil garnished with raspberries and a blackberry. The macaroon on the side was good, but to me the star of the dish was the clever composition in the middle. I tried tasting the different elements individually, and they went almost all the way around the palate, except for saltiness. Sweet, sour, tart, bitter. And then when they all met in combination with the chewy and a little bit gooey macaroon bottom, it was simply a heavenly mouthful. The menu mentions a pre-dessert as a palate cleanser. Previously it has been a ball of sorbet. They forgot to serve it at our table, but they found out and insisted that we had coffee on the house, accompanied with cute cubes of chocolaty caramel. It was a nice finish to our meal. The service was friendly and attentive, and we were given plenty of time between dishes, which we really appreciate. We were served by different waiters, but the manager always kept an eye on our table and checked every once in a while if we were happy \u2013 and it was a pleasure chatting with him. Hospitality must lie in his genes. We agreed that this final festival experience was a perfect ending to this year\u2019s adventure as a group \u2013 and most definitely we\u2019re looking forward to repeating it next year! There are 2 seats left for the Restaurant festival at Ml\u00fdnec this year: 1 seat on the 12/2 at 17:30 and 1 on the 16/2 at 17:30.

It's served on Saturdays and Sundays between 11:30-15:00. The menu changes from week to week. The price is Czk. 1.290, - per person. It includes prosecco, red wine, white wine, beer, coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice and other soft drinks ad libitum. My boss, who is pretty awesome - and has asked me out several times this week - is in Prague with her husband, and I thought it appropriate to ask them out, just once. We usually attend the Grand Restaurant Festival together, but that\u2019s not an option this year. Instead we\u2019ve designed our own culinary week. The menu we had yesterday is below. Food is served at the table. We were given dishes to share, and we were pleased with the portion sizes, which allowed us to taste everything. By the time we had done that, we were also absolutely stuffed. Everything we were served was impressively delicious. The praise came in a stream from all three of us. We were impressed with the quality of the prosecco and wines included in what was effectively an all-you-can-drink package. The service was also absolutely perfect. The team of waiters were quite young and they were well trained in the profession, they were polite, friendly, helpful and had both humour and the courage to bring their personalities to work. When we arrived at 11:30, we discussed whether we could have arrived a little later and still had plenty of time before 15:00. But the service was kind enough to give us plenty of time between courses, we had a good time - and by 14:35 we were ready for dessert, which by the way was a feast of flavours and textures and one of the many highlights of the brunch.

Word is out that they have good food.  My partner and I shared a prawn appetizer. Do Europeans think it's fun for customers to dismember whole prawns, eyeballs and all? It's not! I don't like having to work so hard to get to the edible bits in a restaurant. The prawn flesh was tasty and the lemony garlicky sauce was good enough to eat with a spoon (which I did).  We both ordered the grilled octopus that came with a few thin spears of broccolini and three small whole potatoes. The octopus was perfect.

I love ravioli but have rarely had a memorable one. Particularly in a steakhouse. So I ordered it. This was by far the best ravioli of my life. I am sorry i have no photos. They were round, plump (they are rarely plump enough) with a delicious fresh tasting shrimp and salmon filling in an ok white sauce.,But best of all for me there were no doughy edges. Oh, i wish i had a photo-the whole pasta was stuffed. I\u2019m going back again soon for more. Hubby had a good chorizo steak and grilled veggies. The veggies were onions, green peppers, tomatoes, zucchini all in big pieces, I had a glass of malbec.

If you're wondering where to dine while in Siem Reap, look no further and secure your reservation as soon as possible. We were so fortunate to have secured a table. Seriously, we speak so highly of this restaurant, even compared to the Embassy.  We had the fresh spring rolls and the pomelo salad, the outstanding beef loc lac, fish soup, and chicken Khmer curry. We had three traditional Cambodian desserts. The loc lac was amazing! Amazing! The Khmer curry was the absolute best of all the places we dined at in Siem Reap. Honestly and truthfully, so amazing. As a matter of fact, while we were fine dining at the Embassy, we were contemplating heading over to Haven after to scoop up a heartier meal. The desserts were delicious and like written online, were not sweet, swimming in coconut milk, and served hot. Everything was a winner and the chef was able to make the fried calamari gluten-free as well.  Danke Schoen for the best meal. So looking forward to dining at Haven on our next visit.

The portion size of the first course was huge, and could have warranted for being half the size. Our choice of mains, although different I thought tasted very much the same. The chicken was a little chewy and we just couldn't get excited about it. The service was also just ok, not very personal and not very engaging.

Sure - you can just drink the drinks for theatre and get drunk and fall off your bar stool.  But what we learned over 3 nights is just how much time, energy, intelligence and creativity goes into the formulation of the recipes AND the ingredients that go into them. They make many of their own ingredients, and the processes take a long time and a lot of care and skill.  Now, to the cocktails.  They are unique, fun, beautifully balanced and well worth trying. I won\u2019t say much about them, but if you want to sit at a bar, dressed in a laboratory coat and a safety mask, while a cocktail basically explodes in front of you, this is the place to go!

Waited 20 min for our order to be taken. 45 min until our first course arrived. The samosas were very tasty indeed, the squash soup was tasteless and the colic cauliflower was surprisingly tasty (that from colleague who dislikes cauliflower). Main course: the briani was ok; the lamb ragon josh was not curried enough(I asked for very spicy); the naan was bad enough that a true blooded Indian would not have touched it. The masala was ok but not curried enough; the vindaloo was good (but that is coming from a Texan who is used to Mac n cheese).  After we finished the main course we waited 25 min for the waiter to take away the dishes (after we called over the hostess). Another 20 min to order desert.

The restaurant is located on the hills of the hotel, overlooking the hotel grounds, the sea and the beach. The decoration of the hotel is perfect, in Lanna style (northern thailand style) and the Lanna inspiration can be traced back in the menu... !  The menu is traditional thai with a number of plates from northern thailand (which is a different style from the south of thailand). Everything we ordered came in a very nice presentation and all the tastes were just amazing!! We had the possibility to have different type of rice, which is always great since Thailand has so much to offer on this front. The staff was super friendly and smiling and they contribute very significantly to the overall experience you have at Dee Plee. To me, Dee Plee is part of those restaurants who are truly honoring Thai food by offering to the guests a true culinary experience.  On thing to note, not so many restaurants in Thailand bring you the miang kham when you have dinner. Miang kham is actually the traditional thai snack that people enjoy when they are together. It consists of a bethel leave that you fill with roasted peanuts, coco, lime, shallots and some spicy paste. It is delicious and the perfect snack when you are having a beer or a glass of wine in Thailand but too few restaurants offer this.. I was really happy that Dee Plee has it.  All in all, we would certainly come back and highly recommend it!"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/IngaS422", "user_id": "Jamie S", "user_name": "Jamie S", "user_ta_level": 5.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Utrecht, The", "user_nb_contributions": 65.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 40.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 37.0, "user_nb_photos": 27.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Like a Local;Luxury Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "71296", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g255122-d8382254-Reviews-Little_Blackwood-Queenstown_Otago_Region_South_Island.html", "review_date": "April 19, 2019", "review_city": "Queenstown, New Zealand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Loved being here...", "review": "Had a few nights in Queenstown recently.

My birthday happened to fall during our stay and we tried to get a table online but the restaurant was showing as fully booked. We emailed the hotel and they were able to confirm a reservation for us just a few nights before. Imagine our surprise when we showed up for dinner and the wonderful maitre d' escorted us to the Chef's table! We did the 7 course tasting with wine pairing but we couldn't keep track of what number we were on, very quickly. (There were so many extras!) I have some dietary limitations which the chef was able to work around, seemingly easily. With the entire kitchen on show, it was a delightful experience though very intimate at the chef's table. We were already impressed and pleased with every course that came out but when the Wagyu beef course came out- I may have cried some tears of joy because it was perfection in my mouth. I even halted the chef to tell him how amazing it was in the middle of the course. Every pairing was a classic match to the dominant flavors of each dish. The cheese course was just ridiculous. In the sheer quantity and selection. Delicious but that quantity is rough on the stomach of non French diners. The madelines and after dinner pastry they offered to pack up to have the next morning (we were so full!) and we were thankful we did!!! Those madelines were better than any other madeline I had ever had and that snail shell was perfectly executed laminated dough.  We are no strangers to multi course fine dining in NYC.
