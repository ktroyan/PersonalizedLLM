We had very high expectations. The place was beautiful and every detail was looked after in an excellent manner. If you take friends, clients or a date, they will like the ambiance. Parking was a little tough but that's a Dubai issue.  Finally comes the food. It was a mixed bag. The appetizers were above average. The Beryani was pretty good. The rest of the food was average and the Hamour fish was below average. I grew up in Dubai and have had Indian food in many cities around the world. The food here is nothing special. Very unfortunate as it was one of very few restaurants we were able to try during our trip to Dubai and we didn't expect a well appointed restaurant with Indian food in competitive Dubai to have average food.  You can get an idea of pricing from the attached image. The prices, for an American consumer, were very reasonable. Total for 4 people was around $70 (255 AED)."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/LoveToTravel0007", "user_id": "LoveToTravel0007", "user_name": "LoveToTravel0007", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Houston, Texas", "user_nb_contributions": 195.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 81.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 110.0, "user_nb_photos": 268.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Urban Explorer;Thrill Seeker"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "713", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g312741-d1903366-Reviews-Las_Canas-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html", "review_date": "March 8, 2017", "review_city": "Buenos Aires, Argentina", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "An Excellent Meal", "review": "Las Canas is on the edge of the theatre district in Buenos Aires.

The place is rather small and in a basement. The neighborhood it lays in doesn't really reflect the inside.  Without a reservation you will be seated in the bar area, the music is rather loud but not a nuisance. If you'd like to dine calm I'd advice to make a reservation.  The staff is helpful, but the door keeper at the entrance isn't like, welcoming.  We ordered a 2 cocktails and some food. The cocktails are nicely presented, but as you'll learn in Morocco lots of alcohol. I felt that the mix of the Aperol Spritz was missing and the taste was overkill by the overkill of Aperol. Bellini isn't as nice as the original, not bad but misses that typical martini taste.  Food, portions are rather small and it's adviced to order a dessert or entree if you have more hunger. The wait time is rather long (+-45 minutes) so calculate that in.  Overall I had a mixed feeling. My appetite was a bit gone by the burning smell of some cocktails and the loud music. Tastes of the food are good, but there are better places in Marrakech where you can eat the same for less money. Cocktails are fine if you can handle the alcohol.  Might had a different experience if I sat in the restaurant part.  Finally, the price. It's comparable to European restaurants.

It's just a few minutes walk away from the Basilica Cistern and the Hippodrome and accessed through the And Hotel lobby.  When I arrived, there was nobody else in the restaurant, so the service was rapid and attentive. However, the dish I picked from the menu was off and I was steered towards one of the specials instead.  When this arrived, it was fine - a lamb dish - but I didn't much like the bed of sauce and vegetables it was on - but this is probably my problem as I'm not a big fan of vegetables!

The service was friendly and engaging.Each member of the team was very knowledgeable and took time to answer any questions we had. Every dish was a taste explosion and it was impossible to choose a favourite. The complex flavours were the result of many processes beyond the means of even the most dedicated foodie. All the food was perfectly seasoned, creatively plated and, hot (one of my gripes at so many fine dining establishments).  This is probably the first review I have written where it is impossible to choose a stand out dish. All were perfectly executed. It is obvious that the menu was design as a whole and not just 6 individual courses served one after another.

They serve a tasting menu with very reasonably priced wines to accompany it, or you can go a la carte and either choose a bottle or, again, ask them to recommend wines by the glass. In the wine list they will do 3, 5 or 7 glasses for a set price, so you know what you will be paying. The whole meal was very good value. I wasn't keen on one of the wines and Salvatore changed it immediately, without any hesitation.  The food was very good, but, as others have commented, the wine is really the star. A pleasant experience, although it is very intimate so difficult not to overhear others' conversations whilst you are dining.  The hosts are charming, a really friendly couple and both speak excellent English.  A word of warning about finding it: the street it is located on is very long, we nearly made the mistake of walking from our hotel in Palermo Soho, and it doesn't feel like a very safe neighbourhood. Our taxi driver mistook the address so had to drop us two blocks further down the road as it's a one-way street, and we didn't feel very comfortable walking, especially as we managed to miss it altogether at first.

It is a very busy Italian restaurant and bookings are essential but I think it is trading now on past excellence. The restaurant is on the small side and we were crammed into a small table for 2 right at the back of the restaurant. Given menus and told specials and then took a while to come back for our drink order. We gave our food order at the same time. Our shared entree arrived fairly quickly and before we had finished it, our mains arrived. I commented that we had not completed our entree - no reaction and main meals pushed onto the table. Our entree was dough balls which were ok - really bread rolls with olive oil. For mains we had spaghetti carbonara and zucchini fusilli. The pasta is said to be home made and it was nice but the sauces served with both meals was lacking and the meals were not very hot. It felt like we were expected to eat up and get out as soon as possible so they could fill the seats again.

The fillets were placed on the counter and calls for the waiting staff were made, but it took about 5 minutes from then for the plates to be delivered. The fish was nice in spite of this.

The two men who run the place were so nice, they attended to our every need and went above an beyond when a plate dropped and splattered on my gf's jacket.

Outside dining with blue and white tones, over looking the ocean (if you are there before sunset). Their online reservation system is VERY broken. We had a reservation for New Year\u2019s Eve (we received an email confirmation) but when we showed up, they had no record of it. They informed us that they were not doing the menu that night and sent us on our way - where are you supposed to find another restaurant at 9 pm on New Year\u2019s Eve? We decided to try again on January 2nd. Again made reservations online...and received an email confirmation. Got to the restaurant and they had no record of the reservation...at least this time they accommodated us. As I said before, a lovely setting. Our waiter had some struggles providing us with accurate menu information (actually was inaccurate on his description of several menu items) and overall the service was fair at best. If you are looking at their menu online - DON\u2019T! It is not the same....and the menu at the restaurant was not descriptive - hard to know what you were going to get. We saw nothing served on a salt block. I am wondering if they have changed management or the menu compared to previous reviews - usually Trip Advisor is a good reflection of a restaurant- but not this time - look only at recent pictures and reviews! Most items were very overpriced! We had Tiger Prawn Cocktail - it was only 2 (two!) prawns and cost 750 Bhat! They were good, but really? We ordered two bottles of wine that were listed in the menu for 1700 bhat and we were charged 2000 bhat per bottle! As for main dishes- the ribeye was fair at best, the scallops were 4 scallops - very tender but otherwise very average...the best dish we had was the blue swimmer crab - 4 crabs, very tasty but a lot of work to eat. The Parmesan mashed potatoes were good, enough for two people. The Lobster Mac and Cheese? Not an accurate description at all...it was more of a pasta in a lobster bisque - no cheese to speak of. We ordered asparagus - sorry, they were out. So, I don\u2019t usually tell people to avoid a restaurant - but we had much better meals and experiences in Phuket- eat elsewhere!"}}, "output": {"review_rating": 2.0}}]}}, {"id": "71177", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d23319376-Reviews-Rika_Cihangir-Istanbul.html", "review_date": "January 20, 2022", "review_city": "Istanbul, Turkey", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Perfect!", "review": "Beautiful place!

The best time would be for a morning trip to the pool.  The staff are friendly and welcoming.  The restaurant has a 100K min spend. To sit by the pool on a lounger there is a 150K min spend.  The bathrooms are very clean and tidy.  The meals are reasonably priced and decent sizes.  The pool areas is relaxing and peaceful surrounded by nature, blue colours and the sound of birds / a waterfall.  I ordered a tuna steak on ciabatta. Unfortunately the ciabatta was about a day old & the tuna was very dry. Given the bread wasn\u2019t fresh, it make me slightly concerned the fish might not be either. But nevertheless it was a good value meal for 82K. It also came with fries which was unexpected (the menu didn\u2019t say this). Unfortunately the fries hadn\u2019t been cooked long enough and were still that processed harder raw potato in the middle. The fries would be yummier with salt.  I ordered a fruit salad which had a great variety of fruit including banana, strawberries, rock melon, water melon, and delish tasty apple!! It came with yougert, (granola on the top to my surprise) and lime. The bailenese honey was nice and lime flavoured (not too sweet!). The fruit salad could be improved with more lime, dragon fruit included  It would be nice if the menu ultilised the cheaper local sourced ingredients more - ie. the salmon steak at 210K Could be switched to a seared tuna loin at an affordable price around 15K.  It would also be nice if diary free nut milks were available for the coffee.  I would also suggest lowering the price of the fresh young coconut (even at top beach clubs they don\u2019t seem to reach the 50K mark).  I would also suggest the option of adding sides to the breakfasts - especially a side of avo.  The menu could cater better to vegetarians and vegans or healthy eaters by allowing \u201ca make your own\u201d with sides option.  Overall, really impressed with the local and great taste decor. Will be coming back and will recommend to others.

It\u2019s a cozy restaurant in Firostefani and an alternative to the caldera view restaurants because it relies on ambience and food more than caldera views. Certainly a very welcoming and helpful host and this place is rightly popular. We had booked in advance and that was a good job because there were many ad hoc visitors who had to be turned away as it was fully booked. The food is very homely and of a good standard. I am not sure where many reviewers below have dined but I would not consider the food rates as highly as many have described. Obviously tastes vary. We found it a very pleasant alternative though to many other places we visited in Santorini and it certainly comes at a significantly lower cost than pretty much anywhere with the view out over the caldera. Well worth a visit .

But every other course was amazing - full of delicious flavours, fresh ingredients and always a refreshing take on traditional Khmer cuisine, infused with modern cooking techniques. My favourite was the dessert - a fusion of western and Asian flavours - ice cream, and traditional cakes from Asia.  The restaurant is also beautifully furnished and the wait staff were attentive and responsive. At the end of our meal, one of the chefs came out to meet us and was open to our feedback about the pork course. They also gave us a box of 2 macarons each, which were really delicious (note that i'm really particular about macarons).

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "712568", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

And the meat - let me tell you - it was amazing! it was perfectly grilled, it was tender, juicy and so tasty! They also have a broad selection of wines, which vary in price ranges - we took a bottle of a Malbec for around 30USD I think, which was absolutely worth it.

We were joined by five other diners at a communal table and the food, ambiance and service were great.  Upon arrival you're presented with a class of champagne and offered a selection of bread, cheese and meats. Once everyone arrived, you're brought into the dining room facing the open kitchen and windows that look out onto a terrace where Luis is preparing the wood grill. Before the first course, the fresh cuts of meat and cheese are presented and explained.  Each of the four courses are paired with a local wine which is generously (and continuously), poured. There was so much food and the delicious steaks were so huge that no one was able to finish everything beyond the salad course. I found the $75 per person price more than reasonable given the quality and quantity of both the food and wine.  Steaks by Luis is a closed door restaurant so you must make reservations in advance. Our email inquiry made on the website was responded to promptly.  It's easy to see why Steaks by Luis is one of the highest rated restaurants in Buenos Aires.

As we approached the restaurant my lovely wife noted that it looked somewhat intimate and quaint. Apparently we thought the bar area was the restaurant, and were soon escorted up to the spacious dining room. We were seated at a window and offered menus. The service was great, but the food fell short of expectations, and was very pricey. Our neighbor makes samosas and shares them with the neighborhood, and we expected the same authenticity at Ustav. Unfortunately, the flavors and textures were not there. I ordered the butternut squash soup, which was delicious, but the chicken tikka masala did nothing for me, nor did the kulfi, which I found to be almost too frozen to cut into and more a savory dish than a dessert. The prices were quite high and we did not leave with a good taste in our mouths, literally and figuratively.

From the amuse bouche to the mint leaf tea, we were regained with superb dishes exquisite flavours and stunning presentation. Reading the history of the place, chef was bought in to seek to restore their Michelin star, from what we observed he is well on the road to that. The greatest surprise to us was the celeriac course. I must confess some hesitation as I don\u2019t find it the most inspiring ingredient, but his take on it was brilliant with genuinely impressive flavours The trout was very gently and carefully presented with subtlety. The grouse was equally thoughtfully presented. One genuine stand out was the amazing yuzu dessert with a very playful presentation. It\u2019s slightly disingenuous to pick out any favourites as that somehow suggests others are less worthy!

We were all Americans with one local Argentine but the conversation flowed as freely as the wine. Great to meet with and share life stories with other expats in Buenos Aires. Lots of interesting people. As for the meal, we started with a welcoming cocktail : Vodka, Hesperedina, Jengibre, Aji Amarillo, Jugos de Naranja y Durazno. The six course meal included Pan Integral Casero (a roasted eggplant dish), Berenjena Asada, caldo de Guanciale con Cinco Porotos (an excellent soup), Risoto Negro de Sepia, Adobo de Chancho (the star of the show in my view \u2014 a roasted pork dish that was best pork I have had), and finishing with Cheesecake de Especias (a homemade cheesecake with a tangerine topping(delicious). Each course was terrific and accompanying by well matched wines. The star in wine for me was the Desquiciado Garnacha 2021.

However this is not a stuffy and overly formal dining experience but is contemporarily styled with some left of field options as well as some traditional old favorites. The amuse bouche of warm lobster was a stella beginning to a fabulous evening with lovely pink champagne and moving on to a delightful Provencal ros\u00e9. Dessert was heavenly as was the aged Calvados to finish of perfect evening. Staff were knowledgeable about each dish and very helpful, indeed they welcomed the opportunity to discuss the menu in detail. So price wise its one of those places where if you need to know how much it will cost you can't afford it. Price however should not be a barrier to enjoying a wonderful evening in delightful surroundings.

Impeccable, attentive service from the waitstaff who frequently asking if we needed anything and refilled our water glasses as we needed it. Very nice plump coconut shrimps for appetizer and very much enjoyed the halibut special with quinoa and one of the margarita special drinks while my wife enjoyed a well prepared filet with garlic potatoes and greens. The warm bread with a cinamon and ginger butter spread was a nice touch. Offered a nice selection of delicious looking desserts but at that point were too full to partake. A gifted singer entertained us with music selection from the 60's through 80's. Nice evening spent after a long day hiking around the city. After leaving the restaurant, bought a few items from the retail clothing store located downstairs."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/44statesandcounting", "user_id": "44statesandcounting", "user_name": "44statesandcounting", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Westchester, NY", "user_nb_contributions": 178.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 85.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 60.0, "user_nb_photos": 115.0, "user_tags": "History Buff;Nature Lover;60+ Traveler"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "71306", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293924-d14982709-Reviews-Era_Restaurant-Hanoi.html", "review_date": "August 13, 2019", "review_city": "Hanoi, Vietnam", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "A great taste of Hanoi", "review": "After looking for some great Vietnamese food we found Era in the old quarter of Hanoi.

We started with some of the waitress recommendations; spring rolls, Pho with beef, lotus wrapped minced beef and some grilled chicken.  The food came very prompt and with beautiful garnish on the sides. The spring rolls were very fresh, the beef pho was very refreshing and the lotus leaves wrapped beef tasted fantastically.  We ended with some desserts and coffee and we had an overall great experience.

We went for the a la carte - 2 starters (carpaccio and soup), 3 mains (duck, rabbit and lamb chop & shoulder) and 1 dessert (white chocolate).. for 2 of us.. we couldn't decide between 2 mains so got 3!  All of the food was great -especially the duck, so highly recommend this dish. Being in Czech Republic we wanted to try a Czech wine. A very different wine and not what we'd normally choose, but it did grow on me! Our waiter (light haired middle-aged guy - sorry I've forgotten his name!) was faultless. The service from all staff was fantastic. Very attentive and even offering other wine free of charge when we weren't keen on the Czech!  Thank you again for a wonderful evening! I would highly recommend Blue Wagon.
