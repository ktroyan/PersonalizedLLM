However, i can't fault it :) Prices are very cheap as in comparison same dishes that don't taste as nice cost double around Pub Street-city centre (5 min walk). So it is certainly a good value and portions' size are good. Staff are very attentive, humble and happy :) This place is full of europeans and western people.

It was off-peak season when my husband and I went and we got a reservation through our hotel. Boy am I glad we did because we saw about 10 couples get turned down for not having one. Almost every table was marked \"reserved\" when we arrived at opening.  There is a good reason for the reservations because the food is so delicious, so flavorful, and home cooked right behind the counter by the husband of the husband/wife team. The wife serves the food and takes the orders and she is SO friendly (unless you dont have a reservation).  They have a good wine selection and the menu is significantly large. I was feeling a little under the weather when we got there so I got a soup - oh my gosh - it was just a simple mushroom soup but we soaked up every last drop with the bread and she came over and hugged us because she saw me soaking up the last bit of liquid and laughed at us. But it was that good. We also got the tomato balls, a must for being in Greece, and they were served with tzatziki, SO GOOD. My husband complimented that for a fried food it was so light. We also got the beer chicken and a seabass - both were amazing, we finished basically everything. They also give a complimentary dessert (assuming they rotate). Ours was some phyllo dough with some cream maybe (not really sure) but so good. The wife also takes a picture of every table and puts it on her facebook site, which I think is pretty cool.  We wanted to go back a second time in our 3 dinners we had in Santorini, but then figured we should try something else....regreted not going back.

Sea.Fire.Salt is the premier eaterie at both Anantara and Marriott. It's more of a fine dining experience than other restaurants we ate at and it's fronted by the excellent, well travelled, French maitre d', Laurant. Who's a nice guy and very informative on your food and wine if you need him to be. First time here we had the mixed seafood brick (scallops, prawn, sea bass) and the mixed grill (lamb chop, steak, chicken) bricks. The searing hot Himalayan salt bricks are maybe a little bit of artistic licence and whether or not they contribute anything other than a hot, salty brick to your meal I wouldn't know. But they do make the difference of bringing something unique and interesting to the table. Food was very good, well presented with potato and vegetable sides. Handmade Sorbet deserts are delicious. As always in Asia, red wine served chilled, why do you do that? 2nd time we ate here was the last night of our stay, because it's a very nice place and it's nice being spoiled occasionally. Outrageously juicy Wagyu and Sirloin steaks served with a selection of salts that vary in colour, texture and taste, Very nice. I spoke to front of house when I arrived and was delighted when they managed to find me a non-chilled, perfect temperature bottle of red wine to enjoy with my steak. It completed my meal and I'm grateful for the efforts that were made. Food here is certainly not cheap, but it's good. Undoubtedly you're paying a little extra for the whole outdoor, on the seafront, well presented, himalayan brick, finer experience. Which I enjoyed. And I'd eat there again.

Service was unfortunately luckluster and not up to the standard of a high-end restaurant; in such other premises in Prague the waiting staff would enunciate meals, here no one said a thing and for each dish I needed to go online and check their website.

Background: although our previous visit was marred by a menu/billing mix up the food was clearly very good so I wanted to return to experience it to the full and with that in mind I contacted the restaurant to give them my direct feedback. Pawel acknowledged my complaint and was genuinely apologetic and confirmed that he would make amends on our next visit. As it happens I'm not in London that frequently but circumstances necessitated that I was there a few weeks later and therefore made a much anticipated booking.  In a nutshell, it was a top notch experience -Katie our waitress looked after us like we were VIP guests and it was nice to meet Pawel who gave us a warm welcome and also saw us to our table and last but not least Vanessa the Manageress who came over to say \"hello\". Vanessa was very personable and it was really enjoyable to chat with her.  The whole meal was excellent, my favourite is the slow cooked beef ragu in Chianti -a must try dish!

I was checking out various venues and as it was going to be an early evening meeting I spotted that there was an excellent set menu offering at Theos so I immediately made an online booking to secure a table as it was for a Saturday -success, however, heads up, there's a booking system glitch!  On the evening there was confusion with the staff regarding the menu, initially we were given a la carte menus despite the booking stating it was for the set menu.  In the end is was sorted, to a degree, as we were presented with a set menu option, but, not the one I had booked which included half a bottle of wine per person, apparently that one was not recognised and ours only included a glass of prosecco each! I decided not to make a fuss but clearly I was not happy especially for this mix up to happen in such a reputable hotel/restaurant*  Upon returning home I contacted the restaurant and Pawel was very apologetic and acknowledged that there was a glitch on the booking system and that he would make amends for our next visit......  Anyway, back to to the food -it was all very good and the staff were attentive but needless to say the experience was tempered due to the menu saga along with having to pay an extra \u00a340 (unnecessarily) for wine so I shall reserve final judgement and do a more detailed report when we have our return visit.  *I first frequented the London Intercon about 40 years ago."}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}]}}, {"id": "7197", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g274707-d1097078-Reviews-V_Zatisi-Prague_Bohemia.html", "review_date": "May 31, 2019", "review_city": "Prague, Czech Republic", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Fabulous tasting menu", "review": "We visited V Zatisi to celebrate s milestone birthday.

When we got there about five minutes before our reservation we were greeted by the hostess as we walked up and she knew exactly who we were and seated us promptly on their upstairs air conditioned dining room.  We were attended to right away and seated in a quiet corner of the restaurant. The dining area, table, and the flatware were all immaculate. The menu looked great! We ordered an alcoholic drink and a mocktail, both of which were delicious. The food we ordered, traditional Khmer fare, was tasty. The tables next to us look like they were enjoying their meals too. Constant attention was paid to our table to ensure our water glasses stayed filled and that unnecessary plates were cleared promptly.  Rice was a la carte.  The only very minor issue I had was that the constant movement of the service staff through the sliding door caused the air conditioned room to become warmer as the night wore on.

We were taken upstairs to the cocktail bar for drinks and to wait while they shuffled things around to accommodate us. We were so relieved as we had been looking forward to coming here for ages. Finally we were seated in the restaurant and had a lovely evening with lots of delicious food. We especially enjoyed the starters - the scallops and the hare.

If you're wondering where to dine while in Siem Reap, look no further and secure your reservation as soon as possible. We were so fortunate to have secured a table. Seriously, we speak so highly of this restaurant, even compared to the Embassy.  We had the fresh spring rolls and the pomelo salad, the outstanding beef loc lac, fish soup, and chicken Khmer curry. We had three traditional Cambodian desserts. The loc lac was amazing! Amazing! The Khmer curry was the absolute best of all the places we dined at in Siem Reap. Honestly and truthfully, so amazing. As a matter of fact, while we were fine dining at the Embassy, we were contemplating heading over to Haven after to scoop up a heartier meal. The desserts were delicious and like written online, were not sweet, swimming in coconut milk, and served hot. Everything was a winner and the chef was able to make the fried calamari gluten-free as well.  Danke Schoen for the best meal. So looking forward to dining at Haven on our next visit.

I loved the special touches to the experience- the complimentary bread and butter, mini tacos and fudge were all delicious and an unexpectedly kind touch which I didn't expect given that we were paying with a voucher. Plus these extras helped to keep me full for the whole day! The chequerboard menu was fun and I was delighted with my food (as was my mother). I'd really recommend the celeriac starter - a delicious salty sweetness to it. And the carrot cake was soo good. Beautifully presented food and the perfect portion size for a lunch.

I would take this option just to hear what he has to say. Every dish is presented in an outstanding manner. The taste is simply divine. There is a small bar area at the front of the restaurant where you can have a pre-dinner drink. We did this last night but I would not necessarily say this is essential. They serve some pre-dinner snacks when you are first seated and \u2018my helpful hint is that you order a glass of champagne at the table to enjoy with the snacks.\u2019 There is quite a lot of wine that will be served if you take the pairing option but it is all high quality and mixes perfectly with the food.

Had a Caesar salad by which I judge restaurants at lunchtime. My wife had a smoked salmon salad with pear (unfortunately the tasteless Chinese variety). The Caesar salad came deconstructed! I know this is a fashion but a deconstructed Caesar salad is just stupid. A little pile of Parmesan on the edge of the plate. How are you supposed to pick it up to put on the salad? A single white anchovy (too little) on another side instead of being mixed in the salad. Salad set in a ring of cheese crisp - ok as an idea but better if everything else there as well. The smoked salmon was ok and the bread was good. Dessert menu didn\u2019t interest me - again too arty with poor flavor combinations that don\u2019t mix.

The restaurant is located on the hills of the hotel, overlooking the hotel grounds, the sea and the beach. The decoration of the hotel is perfect, in Lanna style (northern thailand style) and the Lanna inspiration can be traced back in the menu... !  The menu is traditional thai with a number of plates from northern thailand (which is a different style from the south of thailand). Everything we ordered came in a very nice presentation and all the tastes were just amazing!! We had the possibility to have different type of rice, which is always great since Thailand has so much to offer on this front. The staff was super friendly and smiling and they contribute very significantly to the overall experience you have at Dee Plee. To me, Dee Plee is part of those restaurants who are truly honoring Thai food by offering to the guests a true culinary experience.  On thing to note, not so many restaurants in Thailand bring you the miang kham when you have dinner. Miang kham is actually the traditional thai snack that people enjoy when they are together. It consists of a bethel leave that you fill with roasted peanuts, coco, lime, shallots and some spicy paste. It is delicious and the perfect snack when you are having a beer or a glass of wine in Thailand but too few restaurants offer this.. I was really happy that Dee Plee has it.

Unfortunately, we were let down as the food provided, we deemed, was exceedingly average.  We arrived and instantly were put off by the overly loud music. This quietened down significantly as the evening progressed but it was impossible to hear the waitress when our orders were being taken. On top of that, our table wobbled and there was no wedge provided to help stabilise it. Being one of my pet hates, I bit my lip and just rode it out for the evening.  Secondly, the calamari starter was particularly greasy and the portion was far too big a size for just an appetiser. There was no indication on the menu that this portion could have easily have suited four people, let alone a couple.  The main next: a rustica pizza. Again, quite greasy and far too cheesy. The tomato, instead of being layered into the pizza with the cheese, was just dolloped on to each slice. It just wasn\u2019t particularly impressive given that a lot of prior reviewers have claimed this restaurant boasts \u201cthe best pizza in NYC.\u201d  My girlfriend\u2019s gnocchi dish was reasonable but by no means awesome.  It\u2019s a shame, given the high praise this establishment is given. My final and biggest complaint is that this restaurant DOES NOT accept card payments! We actually only overheard this information being passed on to other customers at a neighbouring table and were not informed of this upon arrival. We had no cash. So, we were directed to the RESTROOMS where an ATM is located - huh? How ridiculous. (This ATM also charges to $2.99 to allow you to withdraw cash!)  It is probably with no surprise you may hear we did not tip despite the staff hinting that we did.

There is a small bar area at the front of the restaurant where you can have a pre-dinner drink. We did this last night but I would not necessarily say this is essential.

YUM", "review": "Last year we visited the area and ended up at another well known burger shack. Later that day we stumbled upon Bill's. It looked so appealing and smelled heavenly from the sidewalk. I made a mental note & planned on visiting on our next trip to NYC for the holidays. Fast forward 1 year and here we are at Bill's Bar & Burger!  Upon arrival, we walked inside and found the place pretty packed. We were asked IF we had made reservations and the answer was \"no\". So, we were expecting the worst. However, we were told to head on down the steps and meet the hostess at the bottom of the stairs to be seated. At the bottom, no one was waiting for us. So we approached the hostess stand and got in line there. We explained that we had been sent down from upstairs. After a few minutes we were seated at a HIGH top and given menus. I was a little concerned about the HIGH seats since we had 2 small children in our party, but there were no other seats available at the time. A waiter was around and said he would be with us shortly. We waited and waited and waited. Finally, we see the waiter ask someone else to wait on us. It seemed like chaos.  We ordered 2 burgers and a basket of the sweet potato waffle fries. We also ordered a kids hotdog, which is a foot long! It came with a side of regular french fries and a kids beverage for $10. A regular burger runs around $13 and does NOT come with any sides. Add bacon for an upcharge.  It took about 35 minutes from the time we walked through the door to the time our food was arriving at the table. Everything looked amazing. Burgers were plump, juicy and oh so flavorful. Delish! Bacon was amazing. Regular fries were very tasty, crispy on the outside yet fluffy on the inside. Sweet potato waffle fries were disappointing. They had great flavor but were thin and turned out oh so crunchy and crispy. We asked for a new basket that was not overcooked. Well, we ended up with a second batch of crunchy fries.  Overall, we had a really good meal at Bills Burger & Bar. The burgers were really good. The kids enjoyed the hot dog & so did we since we had to help eat the foot long dogs. Regular fries were good, although they are probably frozen and not fresh cut. Sweet potato waffle fries were a miss. Prices were a tad high, but we expect that in NYC near Rockefeller Center. Dining room area was OK. It felt cramped and I was NOT crazy about the high top tables (for kids or adults). Downstairs seating felt like a basement, where as the upstairs was little more airy with a bar-pub overtone. Restrooms were clean, but one of the toilets kept leaking water on the floor. Staff was friendly. Service is a tad on the SLOW side. So, do not go if in a hurry. I would recommend. I will be back, but next time I will make reservations in hopes of getting a booth or regular table instead.  Bottom Line: Excellent burgers. Well worth a visit if in the area. Would recommend and will most likely be back next Christmas!"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daisyferret1", "user_id": "daisyferret1", "user_name": "daisyferret1", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Bear, Delaware", "user_nb_contributions": 44.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 218.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 240.0, "user_nb_photos": 610.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Nature Lover;Family Vacationer"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "71246", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1223683-d2459474-Reviews-Sea_Fire_Salt_Anantara_Mai_Khao_Phuket_Villas-Mai_Khao_Thalang_District_Phuket.html", "review_date": "February 9, 2018", "review_city": "Phuket, Thailand", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Excellent food and service", "review": "The setting at the Anantara Resort is very beautiful with a view of the ocean and amazing grounds.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.

The modern twist to some of the traditional Indian dishes was interesting and intriguing. It was a treat indeed. However there is once serious flaw: uncalled for, super-sonic serving speed. As one can see from my reviews, I have been to a number of top-notched restaurants, the world over, quite often opting degustation menu to experience their gastronomical skills, to the fullest. Tasting or Degustation menu is meant to make guests enjoy each and every bite of the dishes served, at a philosophical pace, and relaxed mood. Many places normally serve palate cleanser before each new dish arrives. They work to remove any aftertastes lingering in the mouth so that guests can enjoy each dish without continuing to taste the last. Surprisingly, V Z\u00e1ti\u0161\u00ed serves some of its dishes in pairs which results sometimes in different [and wrong] combination than what is intended or appropriate and sometimes, one of the dishes getting cold, losing its lustre. V Zatisi opts to bulldoze it through. Exaggerating a little bit, of course. I am unable to see any culinary justification or business rationale for this unnecessary haste. I would dare to state that it is a cardinal sin to spoil a superb concept in this way."}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/NordicVagabond201", "user_id": "NordicVagabond201", "user_name": "NordicVagabond201", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Stockholm, Sweden", "user_nb_contributions": 107.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 135.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 162.0, "user_nb_photos": 193.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Urban Explorer;History Buff;Thrill Seeker"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "71252", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d10165445-Reviews-Ayamna-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html", "review_date": "September 15, 2022", "review_city": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Fabulous", "review": "Shubham  Treated like royalty as soon as we entered the restaurant.

We took door #2.  Dinner was served in a nicely decorated room, with classic jazz playing in the background \u2013 Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk.  The Khmer Savory Menu looked like a great deal \u2013 55 USD with wine parings.  First a tempura oyster with three sauces. Small, but it was supposed to be just a taste.  Next came two kinds of fish cakes, with three garnishes: one a pickled papaya and onion; a raw green papaya salad; and purple cabbage. Everything was arranged on top of three spicy sauces and diced tomatoes.  This was followed by a chicken soup served over a mix of steamed and fresh vegetables.  We were served a mango intermezzo; and then the entrees. I selected the wok stir fried beef and vegetables, and my wife ordered the river bar fish. We traded off and agreed they were both excellent.

For cocktails we had: The Naked Man Pina Colada Both very moorish, so we had seconds at the end of our meal! We would recommend the spring rolls platter which had two fresh rolls, two crispy seafood rolls and two crispy Hanoi pork rolls. This was followed by a beautifully presented steaming bowl of pho. The pho at the restaurant was a delicately flavoured broth with rice noodles and tender beef. It was different to the rustic flavours you\u2019d get from street food vendors and equally as wonderful. Every pho recipe has some hidden secrets and this was evident in the subtlety different flavours.

Tables are situated around a pool and a central marble courtyard with a mosaic clad fountain. A large speaker provides some cool background beats. The restaurant offers two menus \u2013 Moroccan and Italian \u2013 with the ability to mix and match both. The latter offered a welcome break from the traditional tagines. The king prawns with diced tomatoes and cocktail sauce and the eggplant mozzarella for starters were both beautifully seasoned and bursting with flavour and the home made fettucine and tortellini parmesan cream for main brought back fond memories of some of the best Italian pasta houses. There is an extensive wine list although the Moroccan wine is slightly on the expensive side. The only downside was the service which can best be described as unfriendly and unengaging and we felt a little rushed with courses arriving quickly when we had indicated we would like a break or, in the case of the bill, unprompted. It was slightly odd to be taken to a back room to pay the bill by credit card but I had nothing to fear in that all of the staff were extremely courteous and polite. This was our stand out favourite restaurant during our nine night stay in Marrakesh and we cannot wait to return.  Tip: Ignore the young men waiting to greet you when you leave the restaurant who will seek to persuade you to follow them on a different route back to the main square on the basis that the conventional route is closed at night. This is a standard ruse at this (and many other) locations and an attempt to fleece you of your hard earned dirhams\u2026\u2026"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/Rob007Kent_UK", "user_id": "Rob007Kent_UK", "user_name": "Rob007Kent_UK", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Wye, United", "user_nb_contributions": 516.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 168.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 731.0, "user_nb_photos": 37.0, "user_tags": "Luxury Traveler"}, "history": [{"id": "712880", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g186338-d719675-Reviews-Launceston_Place-London_England.html", "review_date": "March 25, 2019", "review_city": "London, United Kingdom", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Exceptional", "review": "Located on an unassuming picture postcard South Kensington Street, Launceston Place is understated Michelin level cuisine at an affordable price.

The extensive menu meant we never ate the same main course twice, though we always chose the same shared mixed starters. The Valentine's Day Meal was a particular triumph with an amazing variety of meat, vegetables and seafood, including lobster.  I was also lucky enough to be able to eat here for breakfast on a couple of mornings when they opened up as the hotel was very full. The Chef's Signature Eggs on smashed avocado, tomato salsa and sour dough served to the table with a fresh fruit smoothie and sparkling wine made a heavenly start to the day. I was quite upset when this stopped and I had to return to the busy hotel buffet.  Be sure to make a reservation for dinner as we saw several people turned away as they didn't have space. Thank you Takieng for a five-star dining experience every night of our stay. x"}}, "output": {"review_rating": 5.0}}]}}, {"id": "71298", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293974-d13958609-Reviews-Mivan_Restaurant_Cafe-Istanbul.html", "review_date": "September 13, 2021", "review_city": "Istanbul, Turkey", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "10/10", "review": "If you want a break from the hustle and bustle of Istanbul, as well as the touts hounding you to come eat at their establishments,then this is the place to go.

We made the reservation about a month in advance of our trip to Buenos Aires, which was a stopover on the way to Ushuaia and our Antarctic expedition. As many reviewers have already mentioned, it's one of those \"closed-door\" restaurants that is in a fashionable loft and only takes place a few times a week. No sign - just a staff member outside to assure you you've found the place! My boyfriend and I actually walked from our hotel to the restaurant (we needed the exercise to help burn off the calories) - about 4.5 miles (7.25 KM)! We made just in time and were welcomed in to find appetizers (cheeses and cured meats) and a sparkling wine. We had some time to mingle and meet the hosts and to view the meats that would be grilled up for our other courses - deliciously beautiful! At a certain time (a little after 9 p.m., I guess) we were instructed to take our seats. We sat down across from an American couple who - it turns out - were heading out on the same Antarctic expedition we were booked on and had posted on a TA forum thread we started! And the couple to my right (from China) were also on the same ship! I would say that pretty much all 20 or so guests were either from English-speaking countries or spoke English so, while you probably won't meet many locals at SbL, you will have plenty of people to talk to! In fact, as in our case, you never know who you might meet! I actually loved the communal dining aspect - it made the time spent at dinner that much more enjoyable.  The food was amazing. We had a salad with cheese and apples along with a nice wine for the second course. The third course was the most interesting: a mixed grill of identifiable sausages and other meats, plus a few that were *mysteries* to some of the diners. They want you to try before you judge because many people avoid certain parts of the cow/pig on principle. Haha. Some of it I liked, some of it I didn't; everyone had an opinion, but most people were game to try all of it. Plus, they served a grilled provolone cheese that was amazing.  The steaks - the main course - were large (12 ounces); I couldn't even finish mine! It came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes that were scrumptious. But I made sure to leave room for the dulce de leche cheesecake, which was both beautiful and heavenly to the palette. Mmmm, mmm! Did I mention we had wine with all these courses? And it just kept magically refilling?  All in all, this is an experience you won't regret and I think it is actually a really great value for the attention and service (and food) that you get. It is a 3+ hour meal during which you will never be bored!"}, "profile": {"user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/tlowens75", "user_id": "tlowens75", "user_name": "tlowens75", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Aurora, Colorado", "user_nb_contributions": 117.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 323.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 106.0, "user_nb_photos": 6.0, "user_tags": "Like a Local;History Buff;Nature Lover"}, "history": []}}, {"id": "71304", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g295424-d19939225-Reviews-Sette-Dubai_Emirate_of_Dubai.html", "review_date": "September 25, 2022", "review_city": "Dubai, United Arab Emirates", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Visit to Sette JA resort", "review": "The welcome at the restaurant was friendly and professional.
