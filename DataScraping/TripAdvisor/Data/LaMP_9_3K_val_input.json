The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}, "user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hangontravelingwoman", "user_id": "hangontravelingwoman", "user_name": "hangontravelingwoman", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "25-34", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Minato, Japan", "user_nb_contributions": 194.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 17.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 82.0, "user_nb_photos": 343.0, "user_tags": "Vegetarian;Eco-tourist;Thrifty Traveler"}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "8148", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

The six course meal included Pan Integral Casero (a roasted eggplant dish), Berenjena Asada, caldo de Guanciale con Cinco Porotos (an excellent soup), Risoto Negro de Sepia, Adobo de Chancho (the star of the show in my view \u2014 a roasted pork dish that was best pork I have had), and finishing with Cheesecake de Especias (a homemade cheesecake with a tangerine topping(delicious). Each course was terrific and accompanying by well matched wines. The star in wine for me was the Desquiciado Garnacha 2021. Thank you so much everyone for a magical evening."}, "user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/DHCWESTON", "user_id": "DHCWESTON", "user_name": "DHCWESTON", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "50-64", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "Weston, Connecticut", "user_nb_contributions": 163.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 86.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 165.0, "user_nb_photos": 5.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;Urban Explorer;Peace and Quiet Seeker"}}, "output": {"review_rating": 5.0}}, {"id": "8151", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d9806534-Reviews-ASPIC-Paris_Ile_de_France.html", "review_date": "May 10, 2019", "review_city": "Paris, France", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Excellent Creative Meal", "review": "I read the reviews and was still a bot skeptical, but count me as a believer.

We had been put into a private room away from the main area - which we were glad about as it was extremely loud in the main restaurant. The cocktails list is poor - most sound fairly unappetising and the only few we tried were not great & we wouldn't have ordered a 2nd. One had an ice cube in which was the size of the glass so was an utter rip off for what you receive. Once at the table, we asked for the wine list which was apparently non-existent as the waitress came back & read 7 wines from her notepad (not being able to tell us anything about any of them)! She explained they were between wine lists, however even if this is the case its fairly poor for any restaurant to not be able to manage this smoothly. We opted for the safe option of Prosecco and beers - after our 2nd bottle of Prosecco, none of the rest of the bottles were cold which the waitress seemed pretty embarrassed about. She also managed to spill half a glass over my friend when pouring it out. The food was ok, we ordered starters to share (the prawns were tasty) and each ordered a main with some vegetables to share too. At the point of mains, you are basically paying for the spectacle only as the portions are fairly small & food is fairly bland & overcooked. I had the seafood special & the salmon was the best thing since its such an oily fish it could take the extra cooking. The lobster was unfortunately a bit chewy. The egg fried rice was also very blend. Each person also got a pair of ramekins with a couple of sauces - these were not nice & didn't compliment the fish at all, one being overly mustardy - assumably to go with steak. For the entainment value, its a bit of fun with a group of friends but I wouldn't go here just for the food. It was also very expensive for what it is - our bill was over \u00a3120 per person by the end, which was without desserts & there were a few people driving.

After tasting the seasonal menu I can confirm that it is bland not delicate. Tasteless, concept less, unimaginative food served in enormous portions. The big chunk of cod was murdered in a pepper sauce, the large layers of fat inside both pieces of lambs were probably there on purpose but definitely unappetising. Wine pairings with neither kicks nor soul. Mediocre deserts. Petit fours was only three.

In order to dine in a New York City restaurant (12/21), one must show proof of a covid vaccination and we were lucky to also have a reservation for lunch, as the place became crowded quickly. There are 3 levels - the bottom level is the busiest since it is near the bar and kitchen. The 2nd level is smaller and intimate and the top level is reserved for larger parties.  We sat on the 2nd level and it was easy to have a conversation amid the hubub of the other patrons. Our waiter was very attentive and able to answer any & all questions. There was a separate waiter who took care of our water and wine needs.  My friend and I took advantage of the Prix Fixe menu by ordering the french onion soup, mussels, ravioli with mushrooms and chicken paillard. The only dish that was not enjoyable was the chicken - it was very dry and lacked taste. The onion soup was to die for, as were the mussels and the ravioli melted in my mouth.

The toughest decision is whether to have the wine pairing (4 glasses), or not. Have it.  The 7-course meal is presented slowly, and beautifully. It takes about 2 to 3 hours to get though dinner, and each course is fairly small. So although it may sound like 7 dishes is a lot, it feels perfect.  The restaurant, operated by the Kimsan Twins (I don't think they are actually twins), is entirely staffed by women.

Also they were great for vegetarians as my husband is one. Just wished we had discovered this place on night one in Siem Reap as we'd have been back every night.

Alfresco dining is recommended because you will have the unblocked view to the sea and the pool. But get ready your insect repellent and embrace the heat because the fans weren't helping much.

We were joined by five other diners at a communal table and the food, ambiance and service were great.  Upon arrival you're presented with a class of champagne and offered a selection of bread, cheese and meats. Once everyone arrived, you're brought into the dining room facing the open kitchen and windows that look out onto a terrace where Luis is preparing the wood grill. Before the first course, the fresh cuts of meat and cheese are presented and explained.  Each of the four courses are paired with a local wine which is generously (and continuously), poured. There was so much food and the delicious steaks were so huge that no one was able to finish everything beyond the salad course. I found the $75 per person price more than reasonable given the quality and quantity of both the food and wine.  Steaks by Luis is a closed door restaurant so you must make reservations in advance. Our email inquiry made on the website was responded to promptly.  It's easy to see why Steaks by Luis is one of the highest rated restaurants in Buenos Aires.

Nothing different to expect from a restaurant one could say, however, experiences in NYC have not always showed the same.

The entree - a porterhouse for two- was perfectly served, at the right temperature, which is not easy when requesting beef to be bleu!

Went out as a group of friends, and we were truly the minority given the number of tables occupied by people obviously from India. So to me, that's always a sign of an authentic ethnic restaurant outside the actual country it is trying to represent.  As you enter the restaurant, there's a very small (6 person maybe) bar in a street level lobby. Then you go up a flight of stairs to the restaurant. The layout is spacious, open, and has windows at each end of the room which makes the space seem even larger.  The food was fantastic! The wait staff was the only reason I didn't give 5 dots. They were 'very good' too, but not always friendly (we had three different waiters). And although they have a liquor license, we weren't offered the wine list or drinks. We had to ask. Which may be cultural, I don't know. But it was a bit odd.  I will be back.

No huge hunks of meat here - dishes are all fairly delicate and of excellent size so you come away feeling satisfied but not stuffed.. The best bit is the wine pairings..

Well, I\u2019ve been admiring the pictures of Big Boys Burger Club offerings for three years and finally put his claim to the test.  Sorry Fred, the picture simply doesn\u2019t convey the explosion of taste in that first mouthful of juicy double stack burger that is the El Clasico, sheer burger bliss. I elected to have the patties cooked medium well, and the result was a juicy burger with two patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and the tomato aioli sauce. The Big Boy, another winner with the crispy bacon topping the patties. Toasted pineapple slices gave the Waikiki a different taste sensation and the Croc Dundee with the fried egg and beetroot was just an amazing meal. Mustn\u2019t forget the onion rings and the ice cold Changs. My wife enjoyed her Blues Brothers (without the bun) and on other nights the chicken wings , chicken on green plate and those tasty chips.  There are still more gourmet creations to be sampled, another trip from OZ necessary, the YOLO remains a challenge to be tackled.  Great vibe in the restaurant, a warm welcome from staff and the elegant owner, impeccable unobtrusive service throughout.

I am not sure where many reviewers below have dined but I would not consider the food rates as highly as many have described. Obviously tastes vary.

His background in some of the best restaurants in New York City offers an interesting perspective. If the food and beverage were not enough, the interactions and friendships made with the guests takes the experience over the top.

The chef Dan brings vast food knowledge from years of experience, research, and from being a food writer. This is such a special experience that I strongly suggest you book it in advance as to not be disappointed if trying to do so after you arrive in Buenos Aires.

Sure - you can just drink the drinks for theatre and get drunk and fall off your bar stool.  But what we learned over 3 nights is just how much time, energy, intelligence and creativity goes into the formulation of the recipes AND the ingredients that go into them. They make many of their own ingredients, and the processes take a long time and a lot of care and skill.  Now, to the cocktails.  They are unique, fun, beautifully balanced and well worth trying. I won\u2019t say much about them, but if you want to sit at a bar, dressed in a laboratory coat and a safety mask, while a cocktail basically explodes in front of you, this is the place to go!

The swing seating is also quite an eye opener - Elegant, playful, brings a real element of 'occasion' to dining there.  Things started well, but a lack of detail started to emerge once the dining service got under way. The bottle of white wine we ordered was cool not cold upon opening and wasn't at it's proper temperature from the cooler until the last glass; My dining companion ordered the $31 tasting menu whilst I went a la carte.  Their serving procedure was to serve half of the tasting menu dishes in one go, to link with my starter course, and then serve the other half of the tasting menu all in one go again when my main course was served. Never experienced this in our collective lives, and we've seen how it's done in Thai restaurants in Bkk with different orders so it isn't a particular regional practice to cram up tasting menu courses to match an a la carte one. My companion ended up sending some dishes back to hold, to allow her to finish one course without letting the other dishes get cold and of course to concentrate on one set of flavours at a time. Most disappointed.  To be fair, the food was decent, I enjoyed my courses - had a lovely tofu tempura for starters (it was a main from their vegetarian menu) and soft shell crab for mains. All really well made and seasoned. Oh, except the rice - Cold rice. In SE Asia, that's almost heresy.  Service was too variable for comfort - As well as the above, our servers would either swarm around, or disappear - getting the bill at the end required catching the eye of one waiter who Pointed to another one who nodded, who came by a few minutes later to ask what we wanted.  It was too strange, at such variance to our normal experience in SR (and even at the very same restaurant where I'd eaten lunch last year). What made it go from a \"let's chalk this up to bad chance\" to \"this really isn't acceptable\" was that dinner including modest wine, and service ended up at $110 - By far the most we'd paid for food in SR, including at the fabulous Cuisine Wat Damnak."}, "user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/gorpalm", "user_id": "gorpalm", "user_name": "gorpalm", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "man", "user_location": "London, United", "user_nb_contributions": 43.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 134.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 114.0, "user_nb_photos": 150.0, "user_tags": "Art and Architecture Lover;Foodie;History Buff;Shopping Fanatic"}, "profile": []}, {"id": "81175", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60763-d1878682-Reviews-Olio_e_Piu-New_York_City_New_York.html", "review_date": "March 14, 2023", "review_city": "New York City, United States", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Neopolitan Cuisine at its finest", "review": "When you enter this trattoria, you feel like you are transported to the Mediterranean in the \u2764\ufe0f of Greenwich Village.

If we had known about Manzil La Tortue when we were booking our accommodation, we would have definitely booked to stay there. Highly recommended.  Top tip: If you wish to do their pool and lunch day and you're staying in central Marrakech, call up and book their transfer service (costs 150DH each way) to avoid the inevitable haggling with the taxi driver once you arrive!"}, "user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/EFreviews", "user_id": "EFreviews", "user_name": "EFreviews", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "25-34", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "London, United", "user_nb_contributions": 251.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 162.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 145.0, "user_nb_photos": 63.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Urban Explorer;Beach Goer"}, "profile": [{"id": "811860", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g189158-d4955432-Reviews-Augusto_Lisboa-Lisbon_Lisbon_District_Central_Portugal.html", "review_date": "November 22, 2020", "review_city": "Lisbon, Portugal", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Best scrambled eggs ever eaten!", "review": "The best place to have breakfast in Alfama - they may look super simple, but the scrambled eggs were the best scrambled eggs I've ever eaten.

The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."}, "user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/hangontravelingwoman", "user_id": "hangontravelingwoman", "user_name": "hangontravelingwoman", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "25-34", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Minato, Japan", "user_nb_contributions": 194.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 17.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 82.0, "user_nb_photos": 343.0, "user_tags": "Vegetarian;Eco-tourist;Thrifty Traveler"}}, "output": {"review_rating": 4.0}}, {"id": "812138", "input": {"input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g297390-d15690520-Reviews-Rasoi_Ghar_Indian_Restaurant-Siem_Reap_Siem_Reap_Province.html", "review_date": "March 3, 2019", "review_city": "Siem Reap, Cambodia", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Tasty new Indian restaurant in town", "review": "I decided to visit based on the other positive reviews and to check out the new Indian restaurant in town.

There were only four entr\u00e9es to choose from and one was a cheese platter. The other entr\u00e9e choices were sea bass , wyagu beef and sweet breads. My husband wanted none of them however he chose the wyagu beef. The sauce for the beef was excellent and he enjoyed it however at \u20ac135 it should be more than very good . I ordered the Seabass and found it adequate. The risotto with curry that came with the beef also had an excellent sauce. Some of the servers, including James and Amin, were very good. Leopold never brought the citrus vinaigrette I requested and seemed to completely forget it. He also had to be asked to serve us bread. There were many \u201cextras\u201d that were provided at no charge,but being very gourmet,required a receptive palate. I loved the artichoke appetizer bite with curry,but my husband didn\u2019t care for any of them. We ordered a la carte,but with a \u20ac90 bottle of wine ( which was the least expensive Bordeaux on the menu) and coffee, our bill before tip was \u20ac333.

If he would have asked any of these questions we would have told him that the octopus appetizer we ordered was beyond bland. - no salt, no seasoning and the so called grilled octopus had no char and tasted like it had been sitting in muck for so long that the skin was slimy and fatty, like we were just chewing on gelatin - inedible. Our entree, which was just the simple burger, was fine, and that's all. Cooked perfectly, thankfully, but again not much to it. The frites that came as the side were hard as rocks from being over cooked. The wine, cab for me, Pinot for my husband were bitter and tart and we would have liked to have sent them back, but for the server never saying a word to us for the entire meal - he didn't even bring us our food or drinks.

Ordered drinks and waited for the rest of our party to arrive. Everyone arrived but one person arrived by 8.10pm. Waiters come up and took our drinks order and we sat and waited. By 8.45pm we were wondering what was happening with the table so I asked the waitress and they said that they had given away our table as we weren't all here on time. Outraged I asked why no one had told us. Blank faced ignored the question and told me that we were all late and that's the policy. I then asked to speak to the manager who was just as clueless and rude. Not explaining why he had given away our table without informing us. Arriving early and being told to wait in the bar they knew we were waiting for the table yet still they ignored us. The manager said there's nothing he can do as there are no tables and we should wait. By 9.15pm we were still waiting and by then my party was frustrated, hungry and shocked at the service being received. No apology was given and no one seemed to care. We ended up leaving the restaurant and the whole birthday celebration was ruined. We had all travelled from out of London just to be ignored and treated like rubbish.  I would never return to this place again. Clearly it's popular because of the chefs performances when cooking the food but the service is terrible. No people skills.

First, one of the hostesses kept spraying an awful air freshener. It reminded me of being on an airplane in certain countries when they disinfect the plane. Horrible! My husband later learned that they were using it to camouflage a sewage problem they were experiencing in the men\u2019s room. Our waiter started out great, but we never saw him after placing our order as he was then moved to serve a large party. Consequently we never had service again. We had to wait 40 minutes to get our check. A hostess noticed my dissatisfaction when leaving and asked if everything was okay. When I explained about the service, she just said they were busy.

Even the bread they make with little hints of chorizo & pecorino, made with lardo, served with two kinds of butter, and the potatoes delivered in a little cart... Five desserts? Kind of over-the-top I appreciate. The sommelier was from Sardinia. The waiter from Basilicata. They both were warm, helpful, and truly were a huge part of making our experience so enjoyable. Service from arrival to goodbyes: impeccable. If you come to London, put this on your list. But make a reservation. This was a Tuesday night early February and every table was taken (and the restaurant is deceptively large: winds around unfolding to five small dining areas, plus a bar.) One of the best meals of our trip. Actually, the best.

A minimal sald, some starters of low quality and undescribed and some cheese to be shared and a so-so quality steak (very low on our list of previous experiences in the USA or Colombia or Brasil or France).

Well, I\u2019ve been admiring the pictures of Big Boys Burger Club offerings for three years and finally put his claim to the test.  Sorry Fred, the picture simply doesn\u2019t convey the explosion of taste in that first mouthful of juicy double stack burger that is the El Clasico, sheer burger bliss. I elected to have the patties cooked medium well, and the result was a juicy burger with two patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and the tomato aioli sauce. The Big Boy, another winner with the crispy bacon topping the patties. Toasted pineapple slices gave the Waikiki a different taste sensation and the Croc Dundee with the fried egg and beetroot was just an amazing meal. Mustn\u2019t forget the onion rings and the ice cold Changs. My wife enjoyed her Blues Brothers (without the bun) and on other nights the chicken wings , chicken on green plate and those tasty chips.  There are still more gourmet creations to be sampled, another trip from OZ necessary, the YOLO remains a challenge to be tackled.  Great vibe in the restaurant, a warm welcome from staff and the elegant owner, impeccable unobtrusive service throughout.

It's more food than we could eat (and boy did we try!). Favourite dishes included the cashew cheeze, the homemade pakoras and the two curry dishes.  You get free top ups of any dish you want (we couldn't manage that) and they give you doggy bags to take away your left overs. The vegan brownie we had for dessert was TO DIE FOR. Oh how can it be so rich and crispy and gooey all at once, and accompanied by delicious vegan ice cream.  You bring your own booze but we also tried the delicious complimentary tea at the end. They were also kind enough to give us little pots of the tea mix to try at home!  The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, with everyone cooing when their selections arrived, and the staff were incredibly lovely and helpful.

Perfect decor and a lovely staff. We\u2019ve had dinner here in the past and it was awesome but some menu items have changed and it\u2019s a \u201cmust do\u201d if in Siem Reap.

Upon arrival you are guided by a host and taken by elevator to the second floor - the Privileged Floor by Lotus Blanc where Damak Lounge is located. My husband is on a special diet and they saw to his every need. Kanika our host made our first reservation while explaining all the amenities in the area. The restaurant has an extensive wine list as well as cocktails. I had champagne and it was heavenly. There\u2019s no rush, couples and families at tables chatting and celebrating in a low tone. Extremely top shelf. Last year when we were there they had live music but this time a nice selection of soft music playing. I\u2019m writing my review and wishing we were there now! One night we were pretty tired so we ordered and our meal was delivered to our room. It was perfect. If you want something that\u2019s not on the menu, just tell them, and it will happen.

However, we went to AKAR & our minds were blown. A notch above everywhere we\u2019ve been at home and in Bali.  The atmosphere is unbeatable.

Ps: no, this is not \u201ccheap & cheerful\u201d, but it\u2019s also not too far at the \u201cfine dining\u201d end of the spectrum either\u2026. portions are good sized. It is truly a must.  Cocktails also unreal.  If you come to UBUD and don\u2019t try this place, you\u2019ve missed out (and Twist)  Finally - no, I\u2019m not on commission ha ha. I am just on my honeymoon and had some of the best food ever & best service ever.

We decided to have a stroll around some of Lisbons many bars and eateries and graze on some of the fantastic food. ( well that was the plan ) We both liked the look of Grau Douro from the reviews and found the establishment very easily in Rua Dunques de Braganca. On arrival the small (but cosy) place was very busy and having no booking we were offered a seat at the bar.This offer was accepted and the owner came straight over with the drinks menu , we are not knowledgeable about Portuguese wine so asked for some guidance. He asked what we liked and suggested a couple of wines ( neither were expensive) and promptly poured a taste of each, followed by a full measure. We quaffed the lovely wine ordered some more and asked for the food menu. The owner who was clearly in control of the whole show was exhilarating to watch , moving from table to table , laughing and joking with the customers and even playing the accordion from time to time a delight to observe. The food arrived Covert ( bread with oil ) the Prawns in garlic sauce and a portion of Bacalhau a bras (codfish , slices of potato and egg cooked in the oven) both dishes were absolutely delicious. Unfortunately by siting at the bar the Toucinho do Ceo do Avo ( Grandpa`s Heavenly Tart ) was positioned on the bar top just in front of us , so a portion along with a very nice glass of port had to be consumed to finish the night. Everything about the place is fantastic, the food is amazing , the staff are friendly and great , the atmosphere is homely , all in all a great find , needless to say we only managed the one bar that night best laid plans and all that. Grau Douro thankyou for a Fantastic Evening.

YUM", "review": "Last year we visited the area and ended up at another well known burger shack. Later that day we stumbled upon Bill's. It looked so appealing and smelled heavenly from the sidewalk. I made a mental note & planned on visiting on our next trip to NYC for the holidays. Fast forward 1 year and here we are at Bill's Bar & Burger!  Upon arrival, we walked inside and found the place pretty packed. We were asked IF we had made reservations and the answer was \"no\". So, we were expecting the worst. However, we were told to head on down the steps and meet the hostess at the bottom of the stairs to be seated. At the bottom, no one was waiting for us. So we approached the hostess stand and got in line there. We explained that we had been sent down from upstairs. After a few minutes we were seated at a HIGH top and given menus. I was a little concerned about the HIGH seats since we had 2 small children in our party, but there were no other seats available at the time. A waiter was around and said he would be with us shortly. We waited and waited and waited. Finally, we see the waiter ask someone else to wait on us. It seemed like chaos.  We ordered 2 burgers and a basket of the sweet potato waffle fries. We also ordered a kids hotdog, which is a foot long! It came with a side of regular french fries and a kids beverage for $10. A regular burger runs around $13 and does NOT come with any sides. Add bacon for an upcharge.  It took about 35 minutes from the time we walked through the door to the time our food was arriving at the table. Everything looked amazing. Burgers were plump, juicy and oh so flavorful. Delish! Bacon was amazing. Regular fries were very tasty, crispy on the outside yet fluffy on the inside. Sweet potato waffle fries were disappointing. They had great flavor but were thin and turned out oh so crunchy and crispy. We asked for a new basket that was not overcooked. Well, we ended up with a second batch of crunchy fries.  Overall, we had a really good meal at Bills Burger & Bar. The burgers were really good. The kids enjoyed the hot dog & so did we since we had to help eat the foot long dogs. Regular fries were good, although they are probably frozen and not fresh cut. Sweet potato waffle fries were a miss. Prices were a tad high, but we expect that in NYC near Rockefeller Center. Dining room area was OK. It felt cramped and I was NOT crazy about the high top tables (for kids or adults). Downstairs seating felt like a basement, where as the upstairs was little more airy with a bar-pub overtone. Restrooms were clean, but one of the toilets kept leaking water on the floor. Staff was friendly. Service is a tad on the SLOW side. So, do not go if in a hurry. I would recommend. I will be back, but next time I will make reservations in hopes of getting a booth or regular table instead.  Bottom Line: Excellent burgers. Well worth a visit if in the area. Would recommend and will most likely be back next Christmas!"}, "user_data": {"user_id_link": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Profile/daisyferret1", "user_id": "daisyferret1", "user_name": "daisyferret1", "user_ta_level": 6.0, "user_age_range": "35-49", "user_sex": "woman", "user_location": "Bear, Delaware", "user_nb_contributions": 44.0, "user_nb_cities_visited": 218.0, "user_nb_helpful_votes": 240.0, "user_nb_photos": 610.0, "user_tags": "Foodie;Nature Lover;Family Vacationer"}, "profile": []}, {"id": "81294", "input": "HERE PUT PROMPT", "review_data": {"restaurant_reviewed_url": "https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293734-d11962970-Reviews-Barometre_Marrakech-Marrakech_Marrakech_Safi.html", "review_date": "May 18, 2019", "review_city": "Marrakech, Morocco", "review_lang": "en", "review_title": "Excellent food, cocktails and ambience", "review": "Great restaurant with lots of character.

Tables are situated around a pool and a central marble courtyard with a mosaic clad fountain. A large speaker provides some cool background beats. The restaurant offers two menus \u2013 Moroccan and Italian \u2013 with the ability to mix and match both. The latter offered a welcome break from the traditional tagines. The king prawns with diced tomatoes and cocktail sauce and the eggplant mozzarella for starters were both beautifully seasoned and bursting with flavour and the home made fettucine and tortellini parmesan cream for main brought back fond memories of some of the best Italian pasta houses. There is an extensive wine list although the Moroccan wine is slightly on the expensive side. The only downside was the service which can best be described as unfriendly and unengaging and we felt a little rushed with courses arriving quickly when we had indicated we would like a break or, in the case of the bill, unprompted. It was slightly odd to be taken to a back room to pay the bill by credit card but I had nothing to fear in that all of the staff were extremely courteous and polite. This was our stand out favourite restaurant during our nine night stay in Marrakesh and we cannot wait to return.  Tip: Ignore the young men waiting to greet you when you leave the restaurant who will seek to persuade you to follow them on a different route back to the main square on the basis that the conventional route is closed at night.

It's served on Saturdays and Sundays between 11:30-15:00. The menu changes from week to week. The price is Czk. 1.290, - per person. It includes prosecco, red wine, white wine, beer, coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice and other soft drinks ad libitum. My boss, who is pretty awesome - and has asked me out several times this week - is in Prague with her husband, and I thought it appropriate to ask them out, just once. We usually attend the Grand Restaurant Festival together, but that\u2019s not an option this year. Instead we\u2019ve designed our own culinary week. The menu we had yesterday is below. Food is served at the table. We were given dishes to share, and we were pleased with the portion sizes, which allowed us to taste everything. By the time we had done that, we were also absolutely stuffed. Everything we were served was impressively delicious. The praise came in a stream from all three of us. We were impressed with the quality of the prosecco and wines included in what was effectively an all-you-can-drink package. The service was also absolutely perfect. The team of waiters were quite young and they were well trained in the profession, they were polite, friendly, helpful and had both humour and the courage to bring their personalities to work. When we arrived at 11:30, we discussed whether we could have arrived a little later and still had plenty of time before 15:00. But the service was kind enough to give us plenty of time between courses, we had a good time - and by 14:35 we were ready for dessert, which by the way was a feast of flavours and textures and one of the many highlights of the brunch.

It is safe to say that the restaurant didn\u2019t disappoint. We were all blown away by the experience. We were greeted by the manager (I believe) and sat down at a nice table. The interior of the restaurant has been redone, and we liked it. Particularly we liked the acoustics of the room. Noise doesn\u2019t travel from table to table, and we could have a relaxed conversation without raising our voices or listening in on whatever was being discussed by the table next to ours. We had a bowl of bread with 3 different kinds of fresh and slightly warm bread. It was accompanied by a herb spread which had nice, subtle flavours and a perfect temperature. I wanted more bread! But thank God they didn\u2019t give me any (I didn't ask for it), because we were all completely full, when we left the restaurant a couple of hours later. The amuse bouche was delicate foam of smoked potatoes. There were some crunchy bits on top and a bit of sour notes from tiny pieces of pickled vegetables as well. These 2 elements gave some texture, and it was a brilliant little dish. The starter was smoked char with almond milk \u201ccaviar\u201d, beluga lentils, horseradish, and marjoram. The trout had a firm, yet tender texture and had received just the right amount of smoke. The subtle horseradish sauce with marjoram complimented both fish and lentils very well and made everything come together. The lentils were perfectly cooked \u2013 I am not sure if \u201cal dente\u201d is a way to describe lentils, but I\u2019ll risk it. The almond milk caviar was mainly on the plate for texture, I believe \u2013 it didn\u2019t pack a lot of flavour. I like that the \u201ceggs\u201d had different sizes. That worked well visually and also when it came to the texture. The size of the portion was generous \u2013 we all agreed that it wouldn\u2019t have been strange at all, if they had served one piece of trout instead of the two nice portions on our plates. The main dish was veal rib eye, beans, dried beef, beets, cashews, and demi glace. We were given a choice how we would like our meat prepared, and we all chose medium. Mine was closer to medium rare, and that was perfectly fine with me. The first impression of the dish came from tasting the demi glace, which was one of the best I\u2019ve ever had. Only the master of sauces, Steven Trumpfheller, has served me a better one. So rich and full of flavour and reduced to the point where it would make my lips stick together. The steak was tender and well seasoned, and it hade more and deeper flavour than I would have expected from veal \u2013 more like a young bull. There were 3 different types of beans on the side, all cooked to perfection. The beets added an earthy and sweet/sour dimension, and the small bites of smoked and dried beef held it together, although my first bite was very tough (the rest weren\u2019t). Just as it was the case with the starter, everything on the plate created a perfect combination, and the dish was quite filling. I regretted not having saved a slice of bread to wipe my plate clean with. Not to embarrass my two friends at the table I decided not to lick the sauce off my plate, but the thought crossed my mind. The dessert was macaroon in two ways, cherry, chocolate, tangerine, and basil garnished with raspberries and a blackberry. The macaroon on the side was good, but to me the star of the dish was the clever composition in the middle. I tried tasting the different elements individually, and they went almost all the way around the palate, except for saltiness. Sweet, sour, tart, bitter. And then when they all met in combination with the chewy and a little bit gooey macaroon bottom, it was simply a heavenly mouthful. The menu mentions a pre-dessert as a palate cleanser. Previously it has been a ball of sorbet. They forgot to serve it at our table, but they found out and insisted that we had coffee on the house, accompanied with cute cubes of chocolaty caramel. It was a nice finish to our meal. The service was friendly and attentive, and we were given plenty of time between dishes, which we really appreciate. We were served by different waiters, but the manager always kept an eye on our table and checked every once in a while if we were happy \u2013 and it was a pleasure chatting with him. Hospitality must lie in his genes. We agreed that this final festival experience was a perfect ending to this year\u2019s adventure as a group \u2013 and most definitely we\u2019re looking forward to repeating it next year! There are 2 seats left for the Restaurant festival at Ml\u00fdnec this year: 1 seat on the 12/2 at 17:30 and 1 on the 16/2 at 17:30.
