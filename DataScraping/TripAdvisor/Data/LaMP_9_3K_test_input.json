            "review": "We stayed at a hotel nearby and the staff there recommended this restaurant. It was amazing!  You get an Argentine feel as soon as you enter... delicious food smells in the air, lots of wood decor, great ambiance.  Our Portuguese speaking server did not speak English however the menus had an English translation and with some pointing and hand waving we managed to order.  To say that the food was great would be a big understatement. Our steaks were the best that we had ever eaten! We are still talking about them and wondering if we'll ever have the chance to eat any that taste that good again. They were grilled and seasoned to perfection... not to mention VERY generous portions. The side dishes were plentiful and delicious as well.  And at the end of the meal, we were surprised by the bill... at how small it was! There were four of us dining and we had four steaks, four side dishes, a bottle of wine, a large bottle of beer and several bottles of water - our bill worked out to about $20 US each! Unbelievable for such a delicious and plentiful meal.  Needless to say we highly recommend this restaurant for an authentic Argentine experience and the best steaks you'll ever eat. If we return to Buenos Aires again, we will definitely dine here again!"

The food, Burgers, wings, veggie, was some of the best I have had, 20 times better than McD etc. Its small and independent, will definitely visit again. If it was in central London it would be 4 times the size, and packed. A great find in the rough streets of Tottenham."

            "review": "We stumbled on this place whilst walking in Camden. It is on a corner of a backstreet and easily missed. There are a few tables on the pavement but a view you will not have! It is a typical family run taverna as you would find in Greece. Simply furnished with a friendly owner and (I assume) partner plus a menu with all your favourites. Stuffed dolmades were a great starter and highly recommended. The prawn cocktail was served in large quantities with crisp and fresh salad. Sea bass on the bone was amazing as were the calamari being succulent and tender. We had rose wine by the glass but there is a wine list with Greek and European wines. As usual there was complimentary liquor after the meal as well as coffee. This is a place where the locals come and sit as well as those from further afield. Service of food was fast although when the restaurant filled up there was a delay for the bill. This is because there are problems finding staff due to Covid, Brexit and furlough and no doubt will be addressed. We will certainly return although I don't know whether they dance on tables in the evening. The bill for 2 was around \u00a350 including service."

You order at the cash register and they make it in front of you. It all happens fast. No seats, but you can stand at one of several counters. I could use a taco now."

The first night I opted for the Italian menu, after travelling in Morocco for a week during the height of summer and in in the midst of Ramadan, good Italian food was such a welcome change. The second time I was there i chose beef tagine, it was, dare i say, one of the best tagine meal i had.  The setting was beautiful, in the middle of the Riad, you can choose to eat indoor or eating alfresco by the pool. The service was friendly and attentive. Recommended."

I was slightly nervous as to their survival but much to my relief, it was still there!  I went twice this time in three days, both times great service, great banter, great food - a proper breakfast with eggs, sausages, bacon and beans but you can have what you want.  It was much quieter than before but so was the City, hopefully as the world learns to live with C19 and the \"new normal\" things will pick up."

Our only dilemma is now we are obsessed and have no way to get them since we were just visiting. We will never pass up a visit here if we ever find ourselves in NY again. Thank you!!!"

The staff were wonderfully subtle in their service, the menu just big enough to allow everyone their choice and the food was fresh, very well presented and extremely tasty.  This restaurant would not be out of place is any European city as an Asian cuisine restaurant .  There is also a reasonable good choice of wines and cocktails for those who want it .  The prices were a little more than we paid for the previous night's local dinner but no where near what you would pay for that quality of food anywhere else .   Thank you for a really lovely evening"

Good lighting, plenty of fans, soft music. I had the fried fish fillet, on a sculptured bed of mash with artfully arranged green mango salad, it came so beautifully presented, like any fine dining restaurant, almost reluctant to mess it up. Hubby had the Jacket Daniel burger with a side of fries, it's definitely a gourmet burger. For dessert, I had the creme brulee, perfectly caramelised crust, creamy smooth custard. Hubby's dark chocolate mousse was also amazing. We loved it so much, before we left, we reserved a table for our last dinner in Phuket. Compliments to the chef, and Yanick as the maitre'd, and attentive waitstaff. This is the perfect place for a special night out. Try the Monaco beer cocktail."

I have a grilled octopus salad that was addictive as was the cheesecake parfait which I split with my husband only to order another for myself. I have celiac and must eat gluten free and they took precautions that I very much appreciated. Book early as they are always full."

Having had numerous holidays to our Greek Islands cancelled we we were craving good Greek food and hospitality, Andy\u2019s Taverna ticks all the boxes.  The staff were fabulous they can\u2019t do enough for you having first confirmed my email for the booking, Georgina greeted us. The restaurant is in 2 sections the first very full but we were given a quiet table in the corner next door, it even had Greek music playing on the TV.  The Mythos beer went down so quickly we had to order 2 more however the jewel of this whole place is the food.  Two types of Dolmades, one vegetarian one meet plus a plate of Calimari arrived, fresh and delicious with bread. Then the main was Andy\u2019s mixed Souvlaki (we forgot to order fried potato but within minutes the waiter had delivered them no problem) and I had probably the best Moussaka I have ever tasted absolutely delicious just like being in Greece! Every main course is served with a bottomless Greek salad but we could only manage one!  There\u2019s was simply no room for dessert which was a pity but we will definitely return this was an amazing experience thank you everyone at Andy\u2019s Taverna Camden."

            "review": "This review is for my second return visit in January but TripAdvisor does not allow subsequent reviews until at least a month has passed which is a shame as I wanted this to go live immediatlely after our visit.  Background: although our previous visit was marred by a menu/billing mix up the food was clearly very good so I wanted to return to experience it to the full and with that in mind I contacted the restaurant to give them my direct feedback. Pawel acknowledged my complaint and was genuinely apologetic and confirmed that he would make amends on our next visit. As it happens I'm not in London that frequently but circumstances necessitated that I was there a few weeks later and therefore made a much anticipated booking.  In a nutshell, it was a top notch experience -Katie our waitress looked after us like we were VIP guests and it was nice to meet Pawel who gave us a warm welcome and also saw us to our table and last but not least Vanessa the Manageress who came over to say \"hello\". Vanessa was very personable and it was really enjoyable to chat with her.  The whole meal was excellent, my favourite is the slow cooked beef ragu in Chianti -a must try dish!  Sadly I have no immediate plans to return to London but Theo Randall will be on my to do list when I am next in town....."

                        "review": "I travelled to London from little village oooop nooorf called Manchester to attend a reunion in Mayfair and took the opportunity to meet up with my daughter who is currently living in London for dinner so wanted a quality restaurant but nothing stuffy.  I was checking out various venues and as it was going to be an early evening meeting I spotted that there was an excellent set menu offering at Theos so I immediately made an online booking to secure a table as it was for a Saturday -success, however, heads up, there's a booking system glitch!  On the evening there was confusion with the staff regarding the menu, initially we were given a la carte menus despite the booking stating it was for the set menu.  In the end is was sorted, to a degree, as we were presented with a set menu option, but, not the one I had booked which included half a bottle of wine per person, apparently that one was not recognised and ours only included a glass of prosecco each! I decided not to make a fuss but clearly I was not happy especially for this mix up to happen in such a reputable hotel/restaurant*  Upon returning home I contacted the restaurant and Pawel was very apologetic and acknowledged that there was a glitch on the booking system and that he would make amends for our next visit......  Anyway, back to to the food -it was all very good and the staff were attentive but needless to say the experience was tempered due to the menu saga along with having to pay an extra \u00a340 (unnecessarily) for wine so I shall reserve final judgement and do a more detailed report when we have our return visit.  *I first frequented the London Intercon about 40 years ago."

Also delicious but I tried my wife\u2019s Tikka Masala Chicken which I thought was even better!  We all had dessert. I had the tandoori pineapple. Delicious  Can\u2019t fault it Came to about \u00a350pp all in so fair price for such quality"

We emailed Paula when we arrived and booked in for the 2 course lunch and pool day for 290DH, included in the price are your sun loungers, towels, afternoon tea/snack and a sun hat! We also organised transfers for 150DH each way. We loved it so much, that we emailed them to book in again a few days later. However, there was a school group booking on the day we wanted so they emailed us to let us know in case we wanted to avoid that day, which goes to show, they wanted us to have a nice relaxing day and not just take our money for a day at the pool - well done!  The food was absolutely delicious and a good portion size. The service was excellent albeit we had to wait a long time for dessert, which was worth the wait!  The infinity pool is huge and very clean, although not heated, which is a great cool down in the heat. MLT really is a beautiful, clean, friendly place to have a chilled day at the pool, if we return to Marrakech we would consider staying here. Highly recommended.  Make sure you book in advance and I would recommend booking the return transfer service for 150DH each way."

The crispy guanciale lent a nice smoky element to the carbonara. The frutta di mare was good too but the shrimp were very small and probably were a frozen component.  Finished with a pistachio semifreddo, which was very good!  The service by Marcela was excellen  The total, including 2 bottles of water, 3 glasses of wine, a cappuccino and a 15% tip, came to 2600 Ckn or about US$110.00, a bit on the expensive side, but very good."

They should put a sign on the door saying full as the staff had to constantly turn away people.  Quite a few small plates to choose from with an ample list of wines to pair with them.  We had the garlic shrimp, Italian meatballs, salmon in crispy Philo and the potatoes with bacon and cheese. Good flavors, but shrimp and salmon were way over cooked, shrimp could have been a frozen product.  The place feels like a small gathering of friends for wine and appetizers so it's a great concept and the personal service is very good, but our food experience led us to feel that it is possibly overrated."

Then had the glazed perch and the chicken tikki masala...presented very well and great flavors as well. The perch flaked perfectly, accompanied by grilled cauliflower and a leek slaw. Delicious! My wife's chicken was tender and nicely spiced, served with lentils and basmati rice.  Finished with a portion of warm apple strudel ice cream.  Had a nice ros\u00e9 and made for a perfect dinner! Not cheap at 3500 CzK but we thoroughly enjoyed our dinner."

I personally didn't love the space which was quite dark and cramped so I feel this would be more of a winter dining destination (as it is cosy) than a summer one. We would have liked to check out the bar too but did not manage to do that on this occasion. I think, when we dined here previously (many years ago) that we had our meal on the upper level where the bar now is. I was keen to try some cocktails and was told that not all cocktails made in the bar were available in the restaurant and I wasn't sure why but that's ok. I did have 2 very nice cocktails whilst there (pink diamond and a dessert cocktail as I had no room for dessert after the amazing entree and main). Both myself and my husband had the Paua entree which was sublime and we then had mains as follows: Hubby had the beef which was divine and I had the duck which was exquisite. I can't recall the exact side dishes we had but we had 2 and they complemented our mains beautifully. Wine: the wine list was good but not amazing and somewhere as 'exclusive' as The Bunker should have a better selection IMHO."

Hubby had the 18oz bone-in sirloin and son and I shared a Churrasco steak and shrimp salad. Of course, we had to keep sampling the Sirloin. Best steak I've ever had. I can't wait to go back and try the aged Tomahawk. Near end of our meal we had a chance to meet the brothers of K Rico and discovered we've traveled to many of the same places. Before we left, hubby had a flight of Japanese Whiskey (just in) and I enjoyed a Pisco Sour; we both enjoyed our after dinner conversation and drinks. Thank you K Rico for a most enjoyable evening."

You will need to book in advance as it's a training restaurant and they often have large groups in the evening so we opted to come for lunch instead. Its not near town, so you will need to grab a Tuk Tuk to take you there. The food is good but what makes this so memorable is the cause it supports- free education and healthcare for the local community. After our lunch we spent some time with children in their classes (this is optional ) and absolutely loved it. Would recommend it to anyone."

Friendly young staff, simple menu of local and Thai dishes. We had satay and spring rolls, as everyone said how good they were! Followed by chicken in ginger and a Khmer red curry. All dishes were tasty, but the rice stood out! Not just plain steamed white rice but brown, it made a lovely change. The prices were slightly higher than other places but the ethos is good. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s better than the rest as all the food and restaurants we have been to offer great value and similar food. But a nice change"

I had Branzini and my wife had stuffed eggplant. Both dishes were terrific. But I have to give a real nod to service. Our waiter brought 3 bottles of wine for us to try. We selected our favorite and he opened the wine list to subtly confirm the price and selection with me. The concierge at the Essex House recommended this place and we give it rave reviews"

However there is once serious flaw: uncalled for, super-sonic serving speed. As one can see from my reviews, I have been to a number of top-notched restaurants, the world over, quite often opting degustation menu to experience their gastronomical skills, to the fullest. Tasting or Degustation menu is meant to make guests enjoy each and every bite of the dishes served, at a philosophical pace, and relaxed mood. Many places normally serve palate cleanser before each new dish arrives. They work to remove any aftertastes lingering in the mouth so that guests can enjoy each dish without continuing to taste the last. Surprisingly, V Z\u00e1ti\u0161\u00ed serves some of its dishes in pairs which results sometimes in different [and wrong] combination than what is intended or appropriate and sometimes, one of the dishes getting cold, losing its lustre. V Zatisi opts to bulldoze it through. Exaggerating a little bit, of course. I am unable to see any culinary justification or business rationale for this unnecessary haste. I would dare to state that it is a cardinal sin to spoil a superb concept in this way."

This one was exceptional. Great Praline mousse, nice chocolate sphere, nice crumble combination. It was death of chocolate, a very nice one. So let me begin with the starter. The champignons de bois had an excellent taste, an amazing texture. The salad topping was not mine, but all in a bite very good. The main course was an Argentine Entrecote, cooked to perfection. All these dishes are presented in a good manner at a nice location. The ambiance is great, following the theme of this restaurant. The host and the staff in general: keen, nice, helpful and attentive. Nothing to complain about and to be honest: we ate worse at Michelin Star restaurants. The location of the restaurant cannot be found without TripAdvisor. Hence, no mass tourism and no tourists who want to eat cheap and fast. We had a great evening and an absolutely fantastic dinner. This restaurant needs to be visited for sure!"

All dishes were cooked to perfection and the choice of fresh herbs and spices was excellent. We had lobster for starter to be continued with a great steak in a kind of Bernaise gravy. Was delicious. The hosts are very friendly and even the Maitre appeared at the table to ask for feedback. Well done. I finished that meal with a Cafe Gourmet which was a good choice. The only cons was that inside of restaurants in Morocco it is still allowed to smoke, a pitty especially in restaurants like this where you want to discover all tastes. Finally, we strongly recommend this place for sure and advice you to have a reservation in advance."

Straying around the tables you get a visit from here once food is ready. What a funny moment. On our arrival she started her nap at the table next to me. In the moment the starters arrived she immediately woke up and started to \u201echeck\u201c what is going on there. We loved it. Let me get to the starters. The homemade foie gras I choose was delicious but slightly overpriced. 21 Euros for one single slice is too much. Even at Michelin rated restaurants the portion would be better. The main course was great, nothing to complain about. Good usage of spices and herbs, was a nice dish and good eventing. We can recommend this place."

The buffet selection was amazing and was constantly kept stocked up and freshly cooked. The staff were happy to make recommendations and to cook special requests such as noodle. The quality oft he food is excellent. The buffet meals at there Marriott Cafe are well worth a visit but be careful as during low season they are few and far between. They have different themes and in my experience they are all great value. Good for families and they always have child friendly dishes available."

The restaurant is small so reservations are necessary as it gets busy. The staff are friendly and welcoming and the view is lovely over the water. The menu has some Thai traditional dishes but also some not so well known ones and the Grouper with three sauces is our favourite. It comes filleted and has amazing flavours. We ate here twice and if we were here another day we would have been back for a third day. Definitely one of the highlights of staying at this hotel. Do not miss it!"

Very popular and not a huge restaurant so best to book, there\u2019s also a rooftop bar on the 13th floor which has a great atmosphere. Our entire bill was around 3,000,000VND and was very good value."

It is a busy place with a friendly relaxed atmosphere; in keeping with what we experienced at Le Bristol. A pleasant setting and waiting staff were polite and efficient. We were offered a good fixed menu with limited but quality offerings. Enjoyed the beef filet- well cooked and delicious. Entree and desert options were also good. A satisfactory wine selection. Prices were reasonable for what the place is- I would go back!"

We started the evening with their Brie Melters, which are pieces of Brie cheese deep-fried in a homemade batter. We paired the appetizer with a glass of Prosecco, currently on promotion.  Following this, we ordered the Lamb Stew and the Spaghetti Deluxe, in a rich red wine sauce. Sensational!  All-in-all, the quality of the ingredients, combined with the skilled knowledge of the kitchen brigade and the professionalism of the staff made this evening way more special than it should have been.  Highly recommended if you are in Kathu, or in Phuket Town."

The ambience and presentation of the food was nice but the colourful sauces were more for decorative purposes than for taste which was a shame. Maybe it just wasn't to our taste.  The chive dumpling dish was better but the sauce for the veggies was so spicy it was a struggle to finish the dish."

                        "review": "I visited twice in December, once by myself for lunch and again for lunch with hubby.  The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.  The points above wouldn\u2019t stop me from visiting again but there\u2019s room for improvement."

I found out about the business lunch menu from other TA reviews.  Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t afford to visit Chi restaurant for tasting menus that they offer in the evening but this was perfect.  The manager Sarah even came to introduce herself during our meal.  I would definitely like to visit again with hubby."

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."

In fact, the opposite is the case here. The very reasonable $75 prix fixe allows a wide choice of first and second plates, with tradition and experimentation side-by-side. For a group of hearty eaters, don't have a big lunch in advance--we were quite full after the two courses and multiple amuse-bouches, before the very good dessert selections. No complaints here about the pace of service, it was attentive, warm and friendly and not rushed. Definitely would return."

We then saw all the food coming out and it looked beautiful. After a while, we decided some nachos. The previous night we visited a Mexican and had nachos and the ones at \u2018The Street\u2019 were much better. The nachos were that could we decided to stay even longer and order a burger each. We ordered the burger with the 4 different types of cheese and the chicken in cornflakes. Both were delicious and they were huge! We both agreed they are the best burgers we\u2019ve had in a while and we would 100% recommend."

Only opens in the evening, but was able to see a tangle of chairs and tables covered in sheets. Apprehensive. What a transformation on arrival!! Nicely laid out, with elegantly laid tables, plus a \"La Palette\" sign outside on the street. Dimly lit, with triangular bar at the rear. Candles on the tables. Charming staff served us drinks, wine and an excellent meal, in pleasant ambience. Only minor downsides were nearby smokers, and slightly over-loud music. Can recommend the \"burnt\" avocados, coming with prawns on sticks, and also the mains of lamb shank (cooked 7 hours), and the monkfish on the bone, coming with curry sauce and risotto. Fabulous. Thoroughly recommended."

Eventually found it was behind the Caf\u00e9 de France east side of main square, along the alley beside and 100m further on. Small, but with an upper deck, seating 10 tables. Sadly, this was accessed by a very tight spiral staircase, not very suitable for the elderly. Unfortunately, it was pretty full and the service slow. People weren't even served in order. No alcohol, but some nice fruit juices. Decent Moroccan salad starter. The chicken tagine was ok even if the vegetables were overcooked, but the cous cous (also in a tagine) had seriously overcooked, almost unrecognisable, soggy vegetables, and was nearly bereft of its supposed chicken. The one saving grace was that it was very cheap. Not rushing back."

            "review": "We had an OK night at casa SaltShaker, but in the end it was a disappointmet, because we  expected MUCH more.  First of all, the food was ok - there's nothing to complain about. However, it wasn't anyting really special. This is definitely NOT world class, in a city famous for its abundance of world class restaurants. Of course, this insight was a disappointment!  The best way to describe what I mean is:  If I was invited to a hobby cook's house and he cooked such a meal, it would be great. If however somebody pretending to be a knowledgable chef invited me to his and cooked this menu for me, I would clearly think that he was not trying nearly as hard as he could, but was saving efforts...  The Casa Saltshaker guys are definitely to be attributed to the hobby cook area...the problem is that TA rates them in the other category (and they think that they belong there...)  The HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT was however was the complete abscence of any personal interaction on behalf of the \"hosts\". When you \"invite\" somebody into your home and you do not wish to exchange even a word with your \"guests\", this is really a bummer. I had the feeling that they were desperate to put us through the process as quickly as possible, collect our money and send us home.  I certainly didn't feel welcome there.  Exemplatory for the attitude towards their guest was this episode:  Coming in I was thirsty and aksed for a glass of water. They rejected it by saying that they would start serving dinner in 10min. REALLY!? Is THAT hospitality?! No one had ever before denied me a glass of water :-)  Making up for the desaster that our hosts were was a quite nice mix of guests with whom we've had a fun evening anyway, despite the hosts (unfortunately not because of them :-)  Last but not least, the wine \"pairing\" we had with the meal was mediocre. We have had wine pairings in good places in Buenos Aires, so we know what can be expected in this price range. The guys either don't have a clue about wine or they simply don't care (I suppose it's the latter, because it fits the overall picture)."

Garlic bread was devine and curly fries yummy. The Cocktail Amnah also made for my wife was 10 out of 10 she said. Those who like to relax over a game of pool this is available as well. My son loved how the restaurant is underground. Would definitely recommend this establishment."

            "review": "I travelled to London from little village oooop nooorf called Manchester to attend a reunion in Mayfair and took the opportunity to meet up with my daughter who is currently living in London for dinner so wanted a quality restaurant but nothing stuffy.  I was checking out various venues and as it was going to be an early evening meeting I spotted that there was an excellent set menu offering at Theos so I immediately made an online booking to secure a table as it was for a Saturday -success, however, heads up, there's a booking system glitch!  On the evening there was confusion with the staff regarding the menu, initially we were given a la carte menus despite the booking stating it was for the set menu.  In the end is was sorted, to a degree, as we were presented with a set menu option, but, not the one I had booked which included half a bottle of wine per person, apparently that one was not recognised and ours only included a glass of prosecco each! I decided not to make a fuss but clearly I was not happy especially for this mix up to happen in such a reputable hotel/restaurant*  Upon returning home I contacted the restaurant and Pawel was very apologetic and acknowledged that there was a glitch on the booking system and that he would make amends for our next visit......  Anyway, back to to the food -it was all very good and the staff were attentive but needless to say the experience was tempered due to the menu saga along with having to pay an extra \u00a340 (unnecessarily) for wine so I shall reserve final judgement and do a more detailed report when we have our return visit.  *I first frequented the London Intercon about 40 years ago."

As it happens I'm not in London that frequently but circumstances necessitated that I was there a few weeks later and therefore made a much anticipated booking.  In a nutshell, it was a top notch experience -Katie our waitress looked after us like we were VIP guests and it was nice to meet Pawel who gave us a warm welcome and also saw us to our table and last but not least Vanessa the Manageress who came over to say \"hello\". Vanessa was very personable and it was really enjoyable to chat with her.  The whole meal was excellent, my favourite is the slow cooked beef ragu in Chianti -a must try dish!  Sadly I have no immediate plans to return to London but Theo Randall will be on my to do list when I am next in town....."

            "review": "Found out about this little gem on TripAdvisor and I was not disappointed. Almost missed the entrance as it\u2019s very low key. The doorman has to ask us if we were looking for it. It\u2019s in a basement. It\u2019s dark and moody. The bar is great in a small space which makes it personal. The service was quick, friendly and exceptional. The music was really good. The restaurant is through another door and has the exact same qualities. Really really well thought out. The food is simple and from a manageable menu. A had the beef fillet. It was tender and juicy. Lots of flavour. The only thing I would say is maybe more vegetables with it. All that really accompanied it was pur\u00e9ed potato. My partner had the lamb shank. It was a good portion and full of flavour but again, maybe adding more vegetables as it was only accompanied by potato pur\u00e9e. For dessert we had tiramisu and apple pie. At the end we were given a complementary drink. The experience was excellent. I really recommend this place."

It was all really lovely as was the bread served with it. It's a bit of a way from the main town but definitely worth the journey."

It is a friendly atmosphere so we're well taken care of. I had a really hot pepper and a sole file all well prepared and cooked and Tasted good.

It turned out that he immigrated many years ago from Ukraine/Russia who initially studied something else but finally fulfilled his dream and opened a restaurant in Buenos Aires. The service and attitude couldn\u2019t have been friendlier and more natural. We both decided to habe beef (of course) with grilled vegetables and papas fritas with garlic. The food was served fast and smoothly and it was just perfect. Altogether a great, high quality but also unpretentious dining experience for a very reasonable price."

The majority of the clientele were Asian, which is frequently a good sign. The servers/waitresses were friendly and very helpful. The complementary jasmine tea was welcome. The food came quickly and was of excellent quality, full of fresh vegetables and tender meats, with tasty sauces. The quantities were huge, and we ordered too much food, which was boxed up for us to take with us. The cost was very friendly too. Highly recommended. Worth a trek across town. The lucky staff even get to eat their own food."

Food was amazing indeed! Both flavor and serving size was big! We ordered amok, lok lak and tom yum soup plus lime cucumber (not sure what the name was) shake. If only I had more days there, I would definitely keep trying out their other dishes. Can't wait to eat here again when I come back to Siem Reap."

I enjoy good food and i can tell you that this place is the best in patong thanks to Chef Alain who is passionate about food, cooking and making his customers happy! And Georges makes sure everything is going ok during your meal.  We had homemade foie gras, delicious, duck with pinot noir sauce, very very good, panna cotta, so good and homemade too!!  They gave us some complimentary homemade macarons, very good too, everything was good.  Chef Alain is amazing and makes everything himself!

            "review": "Back for the Wines in a Beautiful Venue  We first discovered The Park Room at the JW Marriott Grosvenor House Park Lane Mayfair/London, when waiting for an event, with the Arizona Cardinals NFL Football team. They were in London for a game, and were using the JW Marriott as their base of operations. I then have returned several more times, and been impressed each time. In December, we were back to London, and on a totally leisure trip. We were staying just down Park Lane from the JW Marriott, and my wife asked if we could go to The Park Room for drinks. Well, that was a no-brainer - wines with my wife, with no meetings looming over her head, in a lovely space, just blocks from us. Off we went.  Now, there are three areas of The Park Room, and two are mostly attached, plus a lounge area, just around the corner, with a grand piano, which is more open to the reception area of the lobby. We were seated in the lounge area, near the piano, and I had the wine list in hand quickly. On this afternoon, the pianist was playing, and I think that this is only the second time, when he has been there - quite, quite good! Though the main dining room is gorgeous, one of the things that I like about the lounge area is that it has more of an open view of the attractive lobby - though no views out onto Park Lane, as that main dining area has.  We did the Henri de Villamont Clos Du Cromin Meursault \u201813, the Guillaume Vrignaud Fourchaume Chablis 1er Cru \u201815, and the Spelt \u201cLa Valentina\u201d Montepulciano D\u2019Abruzzo Riserva DOC \u201814. The wine service was great, but while the stemware was attractive (those are Park Room \u201csignature glasses\u201d), I was not that big a fan of the open bowl design - lovely to look at, but not my favorite for wines.  It\u2019s now a tossup, whether I like the main dining room, or this little lounge area the better, but that might depend on whether the pianist is playing. We will be returning, as we have since making this discovery, a few years back.  Though this September visit was our first stay at the JW Marriott Grosvenor House Park Lane Mayfair/London, I had visited The Park Room twice before, once solo, and once with a friend, but this was the very first visit for my wife.  We had arrived from the States a bit too early to check into our room, in the hotel - but this was no surprise, as we had to take a flight out of LAX, rather than SFO, so knew we would be at least an hour - or two - early. That was not to be helped. We did the formalities, and told the reservations agent that we would just find some Champagne in the Park Room.  On this early Spring afternoon, it was as lovely, as I remembered it to be, with sunlight streaming through the windows, overlooking Park Lane, and Hyde Park. This is an elegant room, there is no denying, but it is also a very comfortable room, at least it was for us.  We were seated by the welcoming hostess, at a nice little 2-top, in the main dining area. While not against the windows, we still had a lovely view. From my previous experience, I believe that the dining area, at those windows, is most often used for Afternoon Tea, as it has much more of a salon feel, and look to it. We were in the main dining area, just behind that salon.  We had the wine list in hand, and settled in to relax, enjoy ourselves, and await our room assignment - knowing that we probably had at least an hour, or more.  We started with Perrier-Jou\u00ebt Blanc de Blanc, and a glass of the Perrier-Jou\u00ebt Blason Ros\u00e9. Both were served in lovely flutes.  We sipped, and relaxed, as we had been flying for quite some time, and when the Champagne was gone, moved on to Soellner Gr\u00fcner Veltliner Fumburg \u201816 (a new wine to me), and the Henri de Villamont Meursault \u201815 (also a new producer - we were having fun now).  About half of the way through the still whites, our reservations agent arrived, and offered to show us to our suite, as soon as we had finished the wine. She made certain to give our server the room number, for the charges, which was a nice touch, as we did not need to bother with a credit card.  The afternoon had almost slipped by, and the wait was of no issue. We were in a lovely room, watching Hyde Park across the way, with excellent, and very friendly and attentive service, plus getting to explore some new wines. What a great way to start a holiday. I am so glad that my wife finally got to experience The Park Room, and now it was time to unpack, shower, and head back down to the lobby for dinner - with even more wine!"

I have to say though, the food was slightly better the first time as it was a busier time and piping hot."

All dishes were tasty, but the rice stood out! Not just plain steamed white rice but brown, it made a lovely change. The prices were slightly higher than other places but the ethos is good.

Firstly, there was only two or maybe three options for vegetarians and the food that was served was extremely bland. There was no spice, no sauce, no flavour on any of the food that was served. Despite being a vegetarian I was served a dish that had prawn in and was told that it was vegetarian. I was extremely dissatisfied with the food and it was a rip off considering I was still hungry and actually ate again at home. The staff and chef however were extremely hospital and helpful, I could not fault the service but I would not go back for the food. If you are vegetarian, do not waste your time going here, I will not be going back."

Live piano music in the background, tables spaced out nicely to make you feel Covid safe and comfortable and beautifully presented. All staff wore masks. The food and selection of teas and jams were outstanding. Really recommend trying rose petal jam and wild cherry tea. Altay, our waiter, was very attentive and helpful.  If you want to pamper yourself or a loved one then this is the place to go."

We didn't linger, the vibe wasn't for us, but the food and service was really good."

As we approached the restaurant my lovely wife noted that it looked somewhat intimate and quaint. Apparently we thought the bar area was the restaurant, and were soon escorted up to the spacious dining room. We were seated at a window and offered menus. The service was great, but the food fell short of expectations, and was very pricey. Our neighbor makes samosas and shares them with the neighborhood, and we expected the same authenticity at Ustav. Unfortunately, the flavors and textures were not there. I ordered the butternut squash soup, which was delicious, but the chicken tikka masala did nothing for me, nor did the kulfi, which I found to be almost too frozen to cut into and more a savory dish than a dessert. The prices were quite high and we did not leave with a good taste in our mouths, literally and figuratively. Next time we will try one of the smaller (and hopefully less expensive) restaurants."

In particular, the prosciutto was mouth watering and the panna cotta a delight!"

            "review": "I was so curious to try this restaurant -- Michelin two-starred Korean fine dining? And I don't mean that as an insult -- I'm Korean and love Korean food. But I generally think of plentiful comfort food in a plainly decorated mom and pop restaurant, not haute cuisine. The service was accommodating and helpful. We were there for my husband's birthday, and they presented us with personalized menus that wished him a happy birthday.  We started with an amuse bouche/banchan that included steak tartare, fried oyster, foie gras, and raw fish wrapped in thinly sliced Korean radish. This was unlike any banchan I'd ever had! Although this could have been served at any fine French restaurant, the Korean flavors and influence really came through, especially with the fish. Although recommended that we have 5 dishes each off the regular menu (we opted not to do the tasting menu), we only ordered 3 each, which filled us up. We had the sea urchin for two, bossam (pork belly with dwenjang rice), gom tang (wagyu and pine mushroom soup), crispy red snapper, black cod, and dessert. They also brought another dish for my husband's birthday. If you're afraid of spicy Korean flavors, nothing here was too spicy (or spicy at all), but the Korean flavors were evident in all the dishes. It was really the perfect combination of Korean and French. I highly recommend it!"

The tasting menu is really interesting. They will cater for vegans even when it is not on the menu! Incredible. The staff remember us and provide an incredibly warm welcome on arrival and throughout the evening. The chef often pops out to say hello. The manager is visible and very attentive to staff. This is a very special place tucked away in a residential section of Kensington. We have been coming here for over 15 years and will for many years to come. Don\u2019t wait for a special occasion. Go as soon as you can. Bookings are essential. Highly recommended."

You can add wine pairing for GBP 64. I would highly recommend doing this because Piotr the sommelier, is absolutely world class. His stories about the wine that is being paired are interesting, informative and entertaining. I would take this option just to hear what he has to say. Every dish is presented in an outstanding manner. The taste is simply divine. There is a small bar area at the front of the restaurant where you can have a pre-dinner drink. We did this last night but I would not necessarily say this is essential. They serve some pre-dinner snacks when you are first seated and \u2018my helpful hint is that you order a glass of champagne at the table to enjoy with the snacks.\u2019 There is quite a lot of wine that will be served if you take the pairing option but it is all high quality and mixes perfectly with the food. I can only say: for your next special occasion, make a booking and go. Actually, you don\u2019t need a special occasion to go. Make a booking and celebrate anything you can imagine. This is one restaurant you must experience. Highly recommended."

All the staff are extremely professional,attentive and friendly. Special mention to Goong who looked after us every evening and is one of the nicest waitresses we have met anywhere in the world. @ management please make sure she gets made aware of this review. We'll be back again next year for more delicious food."

Very casual and relaxed atmosphere and deservedly very busy though the brothers still found time to chat to us and make us feel at home. It was very interesting hearing a French prospective on the riots, which had just begun when we arrived. It seems they are as passionate about their country as they are about their food. Well worth a visit and if we ever make it back to Paris I know where I\u2019ll be eating. Thank you guys, you justly deserve your five star ratings."

We\u2019ve been to this resort a few times being MVC members and every single visit seems to outdo the previous one. Service is definitely top-notch and here at the Rim Nam Pool Bar, the service crew - Lert, Sert, Kai, Man, and Peter - certainly go out of their way to ensure all guests are well looked after. For example: You don\u2019t even have to keep asking for iced water, there is always someone walking around pouring everyone a cold drink of water. They also have popsicles in the morning for the young ones. And this afternoon, my daughter met a little accident while running and had small scratches on her knees. Immediately, there was a resort staff to attend to her wound. Truly appreciated! Food and cocktails are delicious! We\u2019ve certainly had more than our fair share of mango daiquiris in between dips in the pool. Now, the beach just a few steps down is gorgeous especially on a warm sunny day! You can take walks, or even a leisurely run, sunbathe, play sandcastles with the kids, and more. This resort is really something else and we always look forward to visiting at least once a year!"

We watched and within 30 minutes the place was full of tourists like us - people couldn't walk past without being drawn in the front gates. They have a gorgeous garden which has been decorated with fairy lights and which has pallet tables where you feel like you are sat on the lawn. There is a tree house where they supply you with notepaper and pen so you can order and pass it down to the staff. There is the beautiful swinging egg chair and the Instagrammable wall mural.  Most places like this are all style and no substance. Wild however is both!  Their unique concept menu only has a few items of finger foods on offer - a selection of fresh or fried spring rolls and some sides. Each spring roll set comes come with a different dipping sauce to accompany them which enhances the flavours perfectly. The portions are quite generous, you only need order 2 sets of 3 for $3 each per person. I am a veggie and there were plenty of options for me which is always great. My husband is a meat eater and loved his choices too. The food was exceptional - you can really tell they thought about each item on the menu and made sure the flavours balanced and it tasted good.  Same story with the cocktails! Imaginative and tasty.  The French owners have done a fabulous job with everything from the decor to the food and the service. Couldn't fault our visit and can see why this place is so highly rated on Tripadvisor!"

            "review": "We learned about Pedro's House of Lamb from fellow travelers we re-encountered while on a walking tour of Arrowton and so stopped by there on our return to Queenstown. We were very impressed by the offering and by the people. Pedro's provides a slow roasted lamb shoulder together with cooked, sliced potatoes, which we call scalloped potatoes at home. We had choices to make: we could consume our order at the picnic tables outside the store; or we could have our order delivered to our accommodation for an additional $8 or we could pre-order and pick up (takeaway?) the meal package at a prearranged time. We opted for the last choice. We had time therefore to explore the Skyline Gondola prior to our return and mealtime. When we returned, our order was not yet ready so we had time to go across the street to the grocery and acquire \"happy hour\" and salad fixings. Returning to our \"home,\" we dined. The meat literally fell off the bone. It was moist, tender, and delicious. The potatoes were fully cooked but firm and not mushy. It was sufficiently abundant to feed 4 hungry adults. Costing $45, it was tremendous value. We later discovered another Pedro's in Christchurch when we arrived there and so surmise that it is a chain operation."

What a pleasant surprise! I had the blackened fish tacos and yummy Sauvignon Blanc from Marlborough, New Zealand, and my husband had the tuna poke appetizer and a grilled chicken and mango salad. He kept commenting how unique and delicious the lemony dressing was. The salad was a large entree sized portion, which you don't always find when you order salad for lunch in Manhattan.  The decor is fun and as you'd expect if someone named Tommy Bahama lived there. The bathrooms were gorgeous, which is always a pleasant surprise in New York City restaurants.  Our server, Jared, was fabulous. Friendly, efficient, and very knowledgable about the dishes (my husband has food restrictions). He is an asset to their team!"

The place was beautiful and every detail was looked after in an excellent manner. If you take friends, clients or a date, they will like the ambiance. Parking was a little tough but that's a Dubai issue.  Finally comes the food. It was a mixed bag. The appetizers were above average. The Beryani was pretty good. The rest of the food was average and the Hamour fish was below average. I grew up in Dubai and have had Indian food in many cities around the world. The food here is nothing special. Very unfortunate as it was one of very few restaurants we were able to try during our trip to Dubai and we didn't expect a well appointed restaurant with Indian food in competitive Dubai to have average food.  You can get an idea of pricing from the attached image. The prices, for an American consumer, were very reasonable. Total for 4 people was around $70 (255 AED)."

The risotto was divine for the second course; so hot and fresh. My husband had Guinea fowl and I had lamb, again both so tasty. The Guinea fowl was on a crostini, so tasty and perfectly cooked. My lamb was served with ratatouille. We both finished off with the ice cream and iced espresso. They piped in chocolate, Happy Birthday for my husband, a nice touch. Our waiter George was very attentive and did a really good job. Our glasses were frequently topped up with Prosecco and glasses of water. Lovely fresh, rustic restaurant with a lovely ambiance. Live musician was also really good. Beautiful hotel with a bar for pre dinner drinks. Literally a couple of minutes walk from Hyde Park Corner tune station. Families dining there but well behaved children."

The self-prepared lunch was yummie and we all enjoyed a lovely time. Thank you!"

I would also like to say that I became addicted to your Tom Yum Goong, it became my favorite dish. So delicious, incredible. We have also tried Pad Thai, Wok fried duck, we took some dishes from kids menu, everything is delicious and made with heart. My favorite dessert there is a Black Sesame Ice cream - you need just to try it!!! We appreciated also, that every evening the chef came to the guests to greet them and ask about their impressions, this is a level of a very good restaurant! Thanks once again and it was so pleasant to receive a post card to our room from Ginja Taste restaurant saying thanks for our visit. We will be back :)"

I dined at a table outside; lots of shady characters hanging about so it wasn't a relaxing experience at all. If you must eat here then get a table inside at least. Bar scene seemed busy and fun however."

On arrival on a Saturday night recently, the restaurant looked very inviting ... but very busy. on being greeted [like long lost friends!] by the front of house staff ... they explained that there was a large birthday party group [which explained the 'business!'] ... suggesting we ordered before the group ... good idea. Initially, there didn't appear to be a 4 seater table available ... but a fellow guest [on his own] volunteered to give up his table. So kind .. and we settled down to peruse the large menu ... with as advertised - European favourites and authentic Thai dishes. The meal was excellent accompanied by a bottle of red .. suggested by the Manager. The service, the food and the ambience were - just as our friends had led us to believe. No wonder they are regulars ... and we will be too."

That happens in almost any resort. One suggestion is to have breakfast themes from different parts of south east Asia."

Lovely decor and presentation, but the food somehow just doesn't live up to expectations. We have traveled to India and are frequent diners at the small places in Edison, NJ (little India) -- places where you get wow (but definitely NOT atmosphere cheap). Utsav is very convenient to theaters, and has a prix fixe menu. We did a combo of small plates, entrees and dessert. The small plates were both excellent -- traditional samosas and a quinoa potato patty. The mains less so. The menu has a combination of traditional and different, and my husband's Baingan Bharta (eggplant) was enjoyable. I had the Shrimp Goa, which was supposed to come in a coconut sauce. It was basically Shrimp Tikka Masala, and it was overcooked. I mean to the point of tough. I've had that issue in Indian places before, but that is a rookie mistake to be sure. Short on time I did not send it back, but also did not love it. The dessert was again quite good, a traditional kheer but with coconut sorbet in the middle. The entire meal cost $150 for 3 people (tax and tip included -- no alcohol). In Edison it's usually about $65 and we have tons left over. I highly doubt we will be back."

Their mission is to train disadvantaged youth to work in the hospitality industry. They have a 16 month training program and support these youth throughout. Our servers were a mix of newer and experienced people. Everyone truly cared that you enjoy what you have, and the atmosphere. We had some outstanding food, including a tofu sate (the peanut sauce was to die for), the pumpkin soup (creamy and rich), the fish with mango salad and bananas in coconut milk (yum!). We ate in the courtyard which was quite charming. Reasonable prices. 5 stars!!"

It becomes a bit cramped with so many people and tables in such a small place (reminded me in way of dining at the Golden Temple in Amritsar). The ordering process is a bit different too - you take a menu sheet and tick what you want - no traditional waiters. The owners clearly know a thing or two about hospitality as the good feeling you get here is all about the food and style. All the dishes we ate were simple, exquisite and original - great flavours."

There are only 24 seats, mostly on the mezzanine area. It appears basic but noticeably clean and tidy. The menu is a blend of Moroccan and international with everything from pizzas, pastas, burgers, salads, traditional Moroccan, crepes, soups. I enjoyed a really good home made courgette and vegetable soup followed by spaghetti bolognese and fruit salad and mint tea (served with complimentary Moroccan biscuits/pastries). As it got busier there was pressure on the speed of service - but I was in no hurry - but all through there was a pride and passion for what was being served and how it was presented. Very inexpensive, an extensive menu and caring service made this place instantly likeable. Good on ya Yassine!"

Unfortunately still disappointing.  Last time: calamari tasted like shoe leather. Tough. I was told \"those are European calamari, not same as Thai\"... ?!  This time: Pad Thai came out almost instantly. It was cold, the tamarind sauce tasted \"off\" (sort of like a fermented or blue cheese flavor which doesn't belong). I wasn't in the mood to complain.  I have not had a dish here lately which I would describe as \"memorable\".  This restaurant should provide a memorable dining experience to guests and visitors. It's a Thai themed restaurant so for sure it should get thai food right.  For some reason, Sandbox's kitchen puts out consistently well tasting dishes but clearly Takieng is struggling and not exactly in the inexpensive side."

In general the Argentinians know how when it comes to steaks but Luis just took it up a notch.  Luis and his team was great - making everyone feel at home and comfortable and Luis was even so kind to let guests turn the steaks and interact whilst preparing the food.  Everything was delicious and the setting beautiful in this 'secret loft' in Buenos Aires. It was one of our highlights whilst visiting Buenos Aires and can definitely recommend this wonderful experience."

Slight mix up with starters but quality of burgers made up for this so still 5 star review"

            "review": "My wife and I had been traveling SE Asia for a month and enjoyed everything from Street food to Michelin star quality.  We where unsure where to try a 'high end' meal in Hanoi, after being given several inconsistent recommendations by previous visitors or tour guides.  For us, Cloud Nine fitted the bill perfectly and we enjoyed our first visit so much that we chose to return again on our final night in Asia.  Located in the La Siesta H\u00e0ng be Hotel, just below the rooftop bar (both reviewed elsewhere) its central to the Old Quarter but has far reaching views in all directions across the city. The decor is undoubtedly chic, with a hint of French presented with a wonderful Asian style and finesse.  They served a mix of Vietnamese and western food, although we only ate from the Vietnamese menu.  They offer a tasting menu at \u00a317 per head but each night we chose to dine a la carte and spent a little more (approx. \u00a325 excluding drinks) but the food, quality, preparation and presentation was absolutely first class.  What sets this restaurant apart though is the quality of service. Anyone who has traveled in SE Asia will know that, if you pay a little more, the quality of service is consistently good. Here it was truly exceptional.  From the very first moment, restaurant supervisor/ maitre d', Amber, ensures that you're welcomed, relaxed and served to your satisfaction. Not that she should have any concerns, as the staff are all, without exception, attentive and polite.  On both occasions we ate here, our server was Huyen. An absolute delight to deal with, her English was seriously impressive, indeed we found her easier to understand than some of our more heavily accented tour guides! She really exceeded any reasonable expectations of service.  On our return visit we were both treated like long lost friends and we'll take memories such as that away with us.  For the record, over our two visits, we ate the special chef spring rolls, Hanoi deep fried spring rolls, Phu Bo, asparagus and crab meat soup, Tom Yum Kung soup, green mango seafood salad, beef on hot stones and Tiger prawns in coconut. We never made it to dessert! In addition, they serve a complimentary amuse bouche to start and a refreshing drink to close.  A truly wonderful experience and I would highly recommend."

We are fortunate to have eaten some excellent meals on five continents but this restaurant served us one of top five meals of all time.  The restaurant is staffed throughout by females and, without wishing to sound sexist, I truly believe you can taste and experience their delicate and feminine touch throughout.  My wife and I were privileged to enjoy their seven course, regularly changing, tasting menu and were rewarded with some exceptional, exquisite tastes. Presentation and service were exemplary too.  Combined with a four glass classic wine pairing for me and a four cup tea tasting for my wife, the cost isn't cheap in Siem Reap terms but at $36 per person for food, $29 for four glass of paired wine or $15 for four deliciously flavoured teas, it's incredible value for money given the quality of food, presentation and service on offer.  In addition we were given complementary amuse bouche to start, had opportunity to thank one of the chefs direct and were given a leaving gift of their exquisitely presented, complementary macaroons.  An exceptional experience that I would repeat in a heartbeat, I cannot recommend this restaurant more highly.  Do not miss."

Situated on the top floor of the stylish La Siesta Hang Be Hotel, there are many rooftop bars in the city but we found the cocktails here to be more adventurous than most.  The bar tenders/mixologists have really tried to come up with some unique flavours so as to capture the \u2018feel\u2019 of this exciting urban culture.  I tried the \u2018Chef Inspired\u2019 and \u2018Guaranteed\u2019: both enjoyable and unlike anything I\u2019ve ever tasted before.  The views of Hanoi are spectacular and, on the floor below, is the \u2018Cloud Nine\u2019 restaurant which I have reviewed separately and loved. They also, of course, serve all the classics.  I would recommend trying this bar for some unique tastes."

The service from the young team in the restaurant was really excellent and we were made to feel very welcome. The restaurant itself is beautiful and the decor and general ambiance very nice indeed. Each course was explained to us and we found the presentation and balance of flavours quite superb - we enjoyed every bite.This is a restaurant serving world-class food and we would highly recommend it, we cannot wait to return."

The food was as always very good, but the service was absolutely not, in fact it was really not what we had expected at all. The restaurant wasn\u2019t hugely busy but we were pretty much ignored by the staff and took ages to take a dessert order then even longer to bring the desserts. If this had been our first impression of the Nai Harn, I don\u2019t think we would have wanted to look any further. Fortunately the staff in all other parts of the hotel are fantastic, friendly and efficient. I just wouldn\u2019t bother eating at Rock Salt next time, which is a great pity."

It is extremely good value for money considering the quality of food, ambience and service.  You can get 2 courses for $12 or 3 courses for $15 including one glass of wine or a soft drink. I found out about the business lunch menu from other TA reviews.  Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t afford to visit Chi restaurant for tasting menus that they offer in the evening but this was perfect.  The manager Sarah even came to introduce herself during our meal.  I would definitely like to visit again with hubby."

                        "review": "I visited twice in December, once by myself for lunch and again for lunch with hubby.  The first time I visited I had to go to the counter to ask for a menu. I sat down thinking they would bring a menu but I changed tables as I was too hot where I originally sat down. I wasn\u2019t brought a menu at either table so I thought they didn\u2019t have table service and you had to order at the counter by the cakes. When I asked if I could see their lunch menu they said they\u2019d bring it over. Perhaps they didn\u2019t see me come in but my first impression wasn\u2019t that good. I know it\u2019s not a big thing but nevertheless it\u2019s nice to be greeted and brought a menu within the first few mins of entering a cafe/restaurant. Perhaps it would be better just to leave the menus on the table.  On my first visit they had run out of the vegan quiche. I understand cafes run out of food but it was a little bit disappointing since it was only around 1pm which is peak lunch time. Luckily, I\u2019m not vegan I just like to eat vegan sometimes but from memory there weren\u2019t that many other vegan choices so this may be a problem for others.  On my 2nd visit I was able to order the vegan quiche and my husband ordered a veggie one. Unfortunately, the vegan quiche had mustard seed and I\u2019m allergic to mustard so I had to swap with my husband. It wasn\u2019t written on the menu so I didn\u2019t know before ordering. It would be nice if this info was added to the menu. I took one bite before I realized. The vegan quiche was not as tasty as the veggie quiche which contains dairy so perhaps a little tweak of the recipe might be in order.  We ordered 2 coconuts and one was nice and chilled and the other one completely warm.  On the 2nd visit we were brought menus straight away but our waitress silently took our order and also didn\u2019t say anything when she brought our bill which my husband commented on. He thought perhaps she didn\u2019t speak English. My husband is a local so she could have used Khmer if she preferred.  I understand this is a training school cafe so I\u2019m writing this as constructive feedback so that others can have a more seamless experience.  The points above wouldn\u2019t stop me from visiting again but there\u2019s room for improvement."

The ambience and presentation of the food was nice but the colourful sauces were more for decorative purposes than for taste which was a shame. Maybe it just wasn't to our taste.  The chive dumpling dish was better but the sauce for the veggies was so spicy it was a struggle to finish the dish."

The night didn't start off well as the security guard watching the motorbikes told us we couldn't come in because my husband is Khmer.  I started to feel my blood boil but luckily another staff member came and said we could come in but we had to go talk to reception (we weren't planning on staying, we just wanted dinner and a drink)  At reception, a lady who was a bit more knowledgeable than the security guard explained that since you have to walk past all the hostel rooms (3 floors) to get to the Sky bar where the bar/restaurant is, they need to take a copy of ID cards for Khmers and a copy of the photo page in the passport for non-Khmers to know who is coming and going for the safety and security of the guests at the hostel.  Once this was explained properly in a polite manner it was not a problem. I still find it a bit strange though as I normally don't carry around my passport when going out for dinner but luckily hubby had his ID card which meant that he became a member and could bring in a guest, me. So, it all worked out ok in the end. It's just a shame that the new security guard (we were told he was new by the other member of staff) is turning locals away.  As with most things here, it is an easily solvable problem. I don't know why they can't put up a big poster saying \"ID card (for Cambodians) or passport (for non-Cambodians) needed to enter the premises for the safety and security of guests and visitors. We appreciate your co-operation.\"  After all, they had a poster saying their restaurant was closed but still welcome to order food at the bar, so they are capable of making and putting up signs.  The food was surprisingly good for a hostel. It was No.1 on TripAdvisor about a month ago and I was curious about it so suggested to my husband that we go.  Luckily, the nice female member of staff (didn't catch her name) and the good food managed to turn the evening around but just be forewarned that if you're not a guest you'll need ID to be able to go into the bar/restaurant area."

            "review": "Nestled in a mostly residential area, it's easy to pass by Blue Wagon and fail to appreciate the magic happening in its kitchen. Mixing creative flavors and proteins (venison, pheasant, octopus) with more traditional Czech fare yields a menu that is fun, challenging and changes frequently. It was so good we ate there on consecutive nights. Each time I had the venison, which is easy to \"get wrong\" -- but it was perfect in seasoning, sauce, cooking temperature and a duet of thin-sliced asparagus and polenta cakes. The plate presentation is as good as any New York high end restaurant - but expect to spend about 1/4 of what you would in the Big Apple. The best leading indicator is the wine list -- carefully curated and personally selected, and priced for you to enjoy a variety of pairings, not make you feel guilty about venturing into new areas. The wait staff knows the wines (including obscure Italian vintages) and was perfectly attentive. Possibly the best meal I have eaten in Europe."

We initially nearly didn\u2019t go because I don\u2019t eat egg but he mentioned they make vegan crepes too with buckwheat! Music to my ears\u2026 I had the veggie burrata, sundries tomato savoury crepe and my partner had the chicken crepe & a Nutella crepe. Must add the sweet potato fries which we had on recommendation are a must! Thank you for a fabulous brunch!"

You could never accuse this venue of being cozy or intimate, it's too spacious for that but it's a very pleasant dining environment nevertheless. Our last visit had been on a Saturday night in May when we had been surprised at how many empty tables there were. This occasion a Monday night in November the reverse was true with most tables occupied, even early in the evening. Our service from Roald was excellent and we hope that he remembers his promise to ensure that we can have zucchini flowers stuffed with mozzarella on our next visit in January! Our food [ starters Italian cold meat platter and Burrata followed by lamb rack and lobster pasta] were very good although considering the price, I felt that bearing in mind the usual generosity of portions in this restaurant the lobster on my pasta was a bit thin on the ground. We look forward to returning once again at the end of January next year."

I've been lucky enough to have some incredible pizza in different places in Italy, and this place definitely holds its own with them. It's very small- I booked a few weeks in advance and you'd have to. Our table was really small, but it was nice to be next to the pizza oven and see everything which was going on. The menu was so good we struggled to choose between toppings, so we had one of the massive pizzas with three different toppings. All were excellent, but the truffle one blew me away. The bottle of red we had was tasty and affordable. Our bill was about 90-100 dollars for two (but then we had the huge pizza which is supposed to be for four people!). Overall, if I was ever to go back to New York, I would definitely be coming here again."

            "review_title": "THE best restaurant in Marrakech. As simple as that.",
            "review": "It's a convoluted route to get to Pepe Nero, but what a glorious experience when you arrive. We had a week in Marrakech, and this is far and away the best restaurant - infinitely better than the posh restaurants around the main squares and far, far better than the supposedly typical Moroccan eateries within the expensive hotels. It's Italian cooking, and Moroccan cooking - two menus; you take your choice, or mix and match from both. The chef trained in London and Italy, and brought his expertise here. The food is very good, the wine even better (feel free to ask if you can taste before you choose, and the extremely helpful waiters will oblige) and the setting sublime, with rose petals in the central fountain, handy loos off the huge courtyard, interesting little atmospheric side rooms and up-and-down, higgeldy-piggeldy steps and corridors everywhere. Housed within the Riyad al Moussika in Derb Charkaoui, it took us about 20 minutes to walk to the restaurant, down a series of winding alleyways and streets, following the black signs, from Jamaa el Fna. However, it only took us 5 minutes to get back at the end of the evening, as we were allowed to leave via the kitchens and a secret back route! The food is excellent. I began with salmon tartare, the only criticism being that some of the avocado pieces in the assemblage weren't totally ripe. My bride had a starter of warm aubergine - a bit like Turkish aubergine dishes. My main course was tortellini - home made in a rich, creamy parmesan sauce. My bride opted for risotto with shrimp. All dishes top-notch, and very filling. The service is terrific, with sparky, cheeky waiters who love a bit of banter. This is a restaurant to enjoy and experience. Pre-booking essential as it, understandably, sells out most evenings. We had an excellent bottle of Moroccan wine - a 2016 Medaillon cabernet for around \u00a325. Total price for two, including water and service, was about \u00a380 sterling equivalent. If this restaurant was in the UK or Europe, it would be 'bib gourmand' status in the Michelin ratings."

We ordered three shoulders of lamb enhanced with rosemary and accompanied by potatoes (not roasted but sliced baked with the lamb).

            "review": "The menu did not indicate many vegetarian dishes, but I asked for Pad Thai without meat and it was made with tofu and extra vegetables and was very good. I didn't particularly like the selection of starters. The vegetarian starter included fried spring rolls, which are unusual in a Thai restaurant (they usually have the type with rice paper that are not fried), and deep fried, battered vegetables, which in my view defeat the purpose of eating vegetables. I did not order wine, but my friends did not care for the wine selections--surprising since it is not difficult to find good wine in New Zealand. The wait staff was good-natured, but not at all knowledgeable about wine."

The restaurant and guesthouse provides comprehensive training to 100 Khmers every year - 70% of them women and all of them from very disadvantaged backgrounds. 100% of graduates (that's more than 800 people to date) have been assisted to find jobs.  The service is the best you will find in Siem Reap and the food is exceptional. You have the choice of a two or three course set menu of western or Asian persuasion or a selection of a la carte dishes.  I can't recommend this restaurant more highly. It's such a great social project - but the food and service cannot be faulted - so it's a win win choice."

We found this restaurant on last Tue (by luck) and since then, we kept returning to this restaurant on the next 2 days before flying back to London on Friday. We just loved their foods! During our visits, we ordered many different types of foods like dumplings, chicken, pork, noodles, fish...etc. and they were all absolutely delicious! (please see my photos for your references) The foods were cooked to traditional Shanghai style and were faultless. I also noticed that most of the customers were local Chinese and it showed \"this restaurant is where the local goes\". The price was reasonable as well. We ordered about 5 - 6 dishes each time and it costed around $30-37 (including tea and soy bean milk) - which was cheaper than a number of restaurants in China Town. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try the real Shanghai cuisines. We really miss this place as we still haven't found a Shanghai restaurant as good as this one in London."

Beer, good tap beers, was shame no Pilsner but the pale ale was good  3. View.....outside, by the lake, can\u2019t buy that view  4. Playlist... if you are a 50 something the songs all took us back to our mis-spent 20\u2019s  5. Callum.....our waiter....what a legend. Friendly, funny, entertaining, helped us around the menu, made our evening memorable! Restaurants need more Callum\u2019s !!  Highly recommended!!"

The food was inedible in parts and acceptable canteen style food at best which just didn't match the arrogant and often unfriendly wait staff. Besides one very charming, eager young waiter who was happily training his English while working on our Spanish at the same time, there were quite a few older \"supervisor\" type staff members around who mostly did nothing but chit chatting to each other. The meal had wine included and we had even double confirmed in writing that indeed all wine is included but alas, in the end one of these supervisors had nothing else to do but tell us upon leaving that \"only half a bottle per person was included and you drank two bottles in total\". Then he pretended to be super generous by telling us \"But that's okay, for you I will take it off the bill\" clearly fishing for big fat tip. Well- not for that \"my friend\", we left without tipping a single cent on purpose while we had originally intended to leave some money. All in all, extremely disappointing experience."

Once enter the friendly stuff opens the door and welcome you. They serve some snacks before we start our main. Too much food i would wish to try but we only have 2 person. So i decided to go with Rice Noodle with nugget and fried tofu. The presentation of the dish was great too.  While i was eating, I accidentally drop my chopstick. Vu the staff was so quick to bring me a pair of new one without me asking. Good observation skill and caring staff.  I would definitely visit this place again when i have a chance to go back to Hanoi."

It was nice and gave us a Prague Christmas spirit.  For starter I choosed the cheeseplatter which had some really high quality cheeses. I then had seafood and garlic bread which tasted heavenly. My husband enjoyed his meal to with veal. We had dessert and a glass of limoncello on behalf of the kitchen, a nice touch.  We had the wine on recomendation and it surely worked well with our menu.  The service was great, very friendly and welcoming. We will absolutely come back next time we are in Prague."

Meal costs $45 and the meat will easily serve 3 (could stretch to 4 but then you\u2019ll be light on spuds). We had ours delivered to our motel room for an $8 supplement (credit card accepted with phone order), which not only saved me the effort of finding them but also meant the food was with us sooner than I could have got it myself! Full marks for service.  The lamb was incredibly tender although not as flavoursome as that offered by a certain Gourmet restaurant in Wanaka, but had we not eaten there I too would give this five stars [as a take-away]."

            "review": "While spending a week in Phuket, we were looking for some good restaurants and we found some good reviews on the Dee Plee so we decided to give a try, knowing that Anantara is a very good and well recognized brand in Thailand.  The restaurant is located on the hills of the hotel, overlooking the hotel grounds, the sea and the beach. The decoration of the hotel is perfect, in Lanna style (northern thailand style) and the Lanna inspiration can be traced back in the menu... !  The menu is traditional thai with a number of plates from northern thailand (which is a different style from the south of thailand). Everything we ordered came in a very nice presentation and all the tastes were just amazing!! We had the possibility to have different type of rice, which is always great since Thailand has so much to offer on this front. The staff was super friendly and smiling and they contribute very significantly to the overall experience you have at Dee Plee. To me, Dee Plee is part of those restaurants who are truly honoring Thai food by offering to the guests a true culinary experience.  On thing to note, not so many restaurants in Thailand bring you the miang kham when you have dinner. Miang kham is actually the traditional thai snack that people enjoy when they are together. It consists of a bethel leave that you fill with roasted peanuts, coco, lime, shallots and some spicy paste. It is delicious and the perfect snack when you are having a beer or a glass of wine in Thailand but too few restaurants offer this.. I was really happy that Dee Plee has it.  All in all, we would certainly come back and highly recommend it!"

We were the only ones there and they gave us the option of indoor or outdoor balcony seating. We sat on the balcony and enjoyed a nice sunny Queenstown afternoon. The service was very attentive and the food we had was nice and flavoursome. I\u2019d recommend the Chicken Pad Thai for sure. Prices were fairly typical for Queenstown.

The staff are really charming, the local dishes were delicious - but if you\u2019re missing western food they have tasty options. We hadn\u2019t booked and were lucky to get a table as the pretty garden was packed. The owner is charming and the banana in coconut milk is yummy."

As i'm still on my strong diet i'm always afraid if they really can/ want how i need it. I ordered beef carpaccio and tenderloin with veg. All done to perfection even without one drop oil. Also very the decoration with the food was very nice... see even diet food can looks good :-)) and be healthy. All came to my table even the kitchen to ask if all perfect and done to my wish. Only can say: better not possible. The way to get there will never be again a problem cause the place, food, staff are perfect. Will recommend and for sure be back soon."

The tables are rustic and you are likely to be sharing a table with others - this is actually in keeping with the warm ambiance of the restaurant so don\u2019t let this put you off. We were given a very warm welcome on arrival and made to feel at home. The food was superb and very reasonably priced (as was the drink). We\u2019d definitely visit again."

The only very slight improvement is maybe take the empty plates away a bit sooner. I think it was out of the staff's politeness and they didn't want to interupt because just a quick glance over and you could catch their attention. Very attentive and I would recommend this restaurant."

            "review": "Was visiting NYC on my birthday and wanted an authentic Italian restaurant dining experience. Traveling with my wife and 7 other friends so I didn't want to risk anything less than a top-notch eatery. Checked TA and searched restaurants in the area we were staying. IL PUNTO showed up at the top of the list. After reading many of the reviews, I decided to give it a try and made a reservation through OpenTable.  Was thoroughly impressed from the time I stepped inside. (Don't let the appearance of the exterior cause you any concern.) The place is small but well-managed. Several tables were full (7:00pm) and our reserved table was ready and waiting. The owner/manager greeted us and promptly seated us. From that point on, service was excellent. The menu (authentic Italian) was full of fantastic choices and made it difficult to pick an entr\u00e9e. On the server's suggestion, I tried the cauliflower soup appetizer. It was exceptional. My main course, ravioli with lobster meat was a good choice, too.  Overall, the group enjoyed the meal with numerous complements on the food.  If you're in the Manhattan (Hell's Kitchen) area of NYC an want \"real\" Italian, stop at IL PUNTO for dinner (only open evenings). I don't think you'll be disappointed."

I went for lunch and loved the Caesar burger and fries. The burger was cooked to perfection and the toppings and bun were fresh. The fries are thin and served crispy, just the way they should be. They also have Czech beer on tap and cocktails to complete your meal. The servers were super friendly they all speak great English. I will definitely be back when I visit Prague again."

But we appreciated the fact that they were very accommodating for our 10-Year-Old's as well as the adults. Our starter was calamari, which was excellent, along with the homemade tomato bread and breadsticks (popular with the kids). He had Cioppino, which was good; and the boys got Ziti with meat sauce and plain buttered noodles (I told you they were accommodating!); but it was my lobster raviolis with pink champagne sauce that stole the show. Excellent wine, excellent service, excellent food = very fine dining. (Or as the boys are telling me, very fancy!)."

The service as first rate. Nothing was too much trouble. The food was superb - all three courses. This was our last night in BA and we had eaten some steak prior to this but were left disappointed by them - the steak here was the opposite - a fillet steak which was cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. My husband is not one for taking photos of food but on this occassion the presentation was just amazing. Don't recognise the experiences posted by other reviewers recently."

The price was very reasonable, not the cheapest place to eat in SR but, considering the quality of the food and the atmosphere, definitely good value and we both agreed Urban Tree was our favourite restaurant during our stay in Siem Reap."

There were no tables inside so we were given a table outside but it was very hot as the cooking was done there too. I think the waiters could see we were melting so when a table became free inside they asked us if we would like to move which was so thoughtful. We did and it was bless to be in the air-con. The menu is small and local but the food we had was really tasty and so cheap we could not believe it. We also had a couple of beers which were the cheapest we had anywhere. You cannot help be impressed with Tevy's story, (which you can read on posters in the restaurant), her survival and the loss of her family members is heartbreaking and now she helps young women have a better life by giving them work and training in her restaurant.  I would recommend this small and friendly little place for lovely and tasty local food and the price is a great bonus."

There's a wide range of toppings, including some that you wouldn't necessarily think of. You can eat in or take away and also there's room service . We did eat out at the Blue Mango a couple of times and the experiences here were really good too. We decided to try to lamb steak at the kitchen table and were so glad we did, we enjoyed it so much we had our last holiday meal at the Kitchen Table, this time we had the pork dish, and this did not disappoint either . The kitchen table is definitely on a par with the blue mango. Poppy and the whole team are so friendly , helpful , always smiling , they are a great bunch, and an absolute credit to their employers. Thanks to all for a great stay!"

Service is soso, not very attentive and not overly friendly.  Food is very disappointing, the salad was ok but the oil and vinegar they use is very low quality. The beef (I ordered a fillet) was not tender and the taste was not good. Also the side dishes were not good. Very disappointing as I know Argentinian beef can be fantastic.  I do not understand this restaurant is rated so high, for me a very average restaurant. I cannot recommend and will definitely not return."

I opted for the chicken Vindaloo - a hot dish for those into spice. I particularly liked the finishing touches of Mukhwas, which serves as authentic after dinner mints. /Mukh/ and /vas/ - denoted in the name, Mukhwas - literally translate as mouth and smell.  A meal consisting of a meat curry, rice, garlic naan (breads), five drinks and a Kulfi (Indian ice-cream) came to a very reasonable 840 CZK (just under 30GBP). This was plenty for the two of us and shall be returning with friends over the next couple of weeks.  As for the service I cannot fault it and was the prominent quality of our dining experience. The waiters greeted me with clemency and their attention to our overall comfort throughout our dining experience was sharp."

I had the French onion soup, which as others have reported is very good, very authentic and on the large size for an appetizer.  We ordered the chateaubriand medium rare, allowing that the ends would be closer to medium. It came out a little under where we would have liked it, but it was acceptable and very, very good. The veggies served with it were also nice, but for some reason the bone marrow didn\u2019t hit the spot(normally I love it).  Now to the elephant in the room \u2026 THE WINE LIST ! I mean ?!$&@%*^}{!!!  I think there was less than 5% under $100. And some of those $100 bottles were $20 retail and who knows what the restaurant pays. I know we have inflation, but the wine list has ENORMOUS 4-5x markups (or more).  Food 9/10 Service 8/10 (slow start)"

The staff are very attentive and even allowed me to use my limited Italian without laughing at me. It was about $230 for 3 courses and wine but we left feeling like it was certainly worth it A nice restaurant for a special occasion and my wife loved the veal Marsala. Make sure you have a limoncello with dessert."

The food was perfection, tasty, fresh, and so enjoyable I found it hard to stop eating even though I was completely full. We meet the owners after we commented on how we enjoyed it and that just topped the night off. We only have three days left but I am coming back."

I mentioned it was my wife's birthday and was hoping for cake or something, but disappointed that I did not receive this especially as Clara had mentioned this in her emails to me.  However the food was good, the service and the staff not the friendliest I found but the garden was nice."

The view from the restaurant was great. Good before the sunset so that you can enjoy both the sunset and the night view.  Alfresco dining is recommended because you will have the unblocked view to the sea and the pool. But get ready your insect repellent and embrace the heat because the fans weren't helping much.  We ordered a set menu for 2 pax. Was decent but nothing exceptional. The pace of serving was a little too lengthy, we actually got bored waiting for food after a while. We got seated by 6 pm and we left the restaurant at 8.30 pm.  Would I recommend this to anyone? If you are staying at the resort, why not because you don't have much choices there.  If you are making a trip here from elsewhere, I don't think you miss much."

The menu changes regularly so any particular dishes may not be available. But it's part of the fun that you're not sure what you're going to get until you arrive. They were very accommodating about my scallop allergy and my partner's pescatarianism. Wherever you're from, I don't think you'd ever get a dinner and service of this quality for anything close to this price. A must do in Siem Reap."

We were shown directly to our table in a strategic corner so we could see the entire place and everything everyone ordered. Everything was delicious and well-presented on the plate. The service really stood out, friendly without being cloying. The eclectic design of the room lends an informal atmosphere that makes for a comfortable dinner. Exhausted from our overnight trip, we opted for an early evening and the owner seemed concerned we had not thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Au P\u2019tit Curieux, but we had. It was a wonderful neighborhood spot with a real flair for entertaining."

It looked as if it had been recently renovated, as the tables and decoration looked fresh and tidy. The waitresses were attentive and always on the lookout to serve. The menu is small, but has a good enough selection of different dishes. We chose a salad and calamari as an appetizer, which were very nicely presented, but the taste of the salad sauce was just delicious! For main course I had the Paella, beautifully presented and extremely tasty and my wife the fish dish - very fresh and also delicious. We will be back soon again!"

Showed up a little late (probably around 2pm) but they didn't mind at all and served us with a smile. We got the two-course lunch menu but got an amuse-bouche to start and Petit fours to finish. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable and willing to chat about the food, wine, and city. Would highly recommend to anyone going to Prague - a great break from all the heavy Czech food."

We had a great meal and the servers were very helpful with describing the menu and offering opinions on our choices. Cheryl had the pulled pork and I had the skirt steak. We have learned that in Argentina the quality of the beef is very good and the vast majority is free range grass fed. BUT, almost all chefs have a tendency to over cook the beef compared to our North American standards so adjust your preference and clarify the redness / pinkness you want your steaks."
